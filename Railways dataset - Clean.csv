Today (02/03/2020) in I am traveling from Dehradun to Delhi in Jan Shatabdi and I found that the food quality in this train has improved TO WORST ""I ordered one Aloo Paratha and I found hair in it and requests to replace it. The employee selling the paratha, refused to replace it as the pack was opened. The tone used by the employee was very harsh.. I guess he was illiterate and having some pan masala"
1,I've always faced this issue whenever I travelled in indian Railways.. I dont know why do they stop at any location for so long... Every time i travelled I was atleast qn hour late some times like 3 hours late...
2,"IRCTC:- Drama of sleeping by administrator

IRCTC means Indian railway catering and tourist co-operation.

its easy to wake up someone who is slept, but its most difficult to wake up someone who is acting as if it is slept:- unknown

As far as I know, every organisation are meant to be formed for the smooth public service, IRCTC might be helpful in some cases, but true fact that is this governing body really working for the welfare of public in INDIAN RAILWAYS which is having annual profit of more than thousands of crores every year.....?

i dont want to compain to any people here, because perhaps the administration system is itself not working or may be it is playing the drama of being unknown about the every incident which is hurting public and inner tourist who are using the railway transport system while travelling from one place of India to another...

perhaps these might be difficulties not only of me alone, but the every traveller who had a unusual day while travelling from railway...

Usually, we know that IRCTC is given duty of servicing people in catering sector in indian railway inside railway and inside the platform of Railways...

let us talk about the food inside railways....

I normally dont know what is the condition in first class compartment, but talking about the second class compartment, food is not better than of good quality, very high prices and un-reliable time table of serving Food..

the first thing that comes in my mind about food is third class and bad quality of tea in RS 5,

not a single constumer takes it from all satisfaction and as a result, we have to take tea outside of catering server when any platform comes because the outer tea is much cheaper with atleast good taste.

lunch, dinner and other food are not of good quality, and perhaps everyone knows the quality of lunch and dinner in railways... Because there is no option other than going for those food, we have to take these food just for the sake of stomach....

Well.. The MRP of food product is said to be the maximum retailing price of any product and in this price the benefits as well as every taxes..

But, we wont get any food on MRP rate, always the higher rate than of listed tag price

while asking why price is high than of tag price, they say, its simply the order by our owner.....

the each and every product is expensive by RS 2 while the soft drinks of MRP 20 are sold in RS 25

morever, even in the railway platform, the price is really higher....

and many times, the food inside the canteen in long route railway seems of food of last night

now the question comes here....

why this negligent is being done by the adminstration of railway and IRCTC?

Do they want to make more profit in railway by those raised high price?

perhaps they have never travelled by indian railway, so this might be the unawareness... but why are they not taking any action in those contractors and worker who takes high price and prepares low quality food...?

this is not about paying RS 2 extra... but this is because of where our systems damages from small level.. and this is place from where the corruption starts...


Every people are tired of compalining, but if anyone in IRCTC and railway is really waking here, I advice you to take the immediate action and solve the people....


Dear MSians, let me know what do u feel on this topic...

And dear administrators of moutshut.com, I hereby request you to forward this review to concerned department so that they may be still not sleeping...

Recomendation of yes because there is no other option...

because better than having no food, atleast have some food...
"
1,Wow as you can see that cleanness of the train so much of water on the floor traveler can not keep their luggage safely and seat was too dirty.... If u are think that you will call housekeeping so forget about that bcs you will call but they want to come and clean bcs every staff have a great attitude I ask one staff he said this is not my problem and then I ask T. T he also said he will come but I think he will come when we will reached the destination.. Why its not clean before arrived at station .... Pls guys if you guys will work like this I m telling you the coming time no one will come to these type of train.. Train number 12621 tamilnadu express.. Hope you guys will do better work on it..
1,"I am a passenger of Indian railway since my childhood as my father was in transferable job in a year I have 2 spend at least 20 days in train now my work is also same since past 30 years railway could not improve itself on any of its dimensions. Weather it be running on time or the availability of seat or bribe monster ticketcheckers.

I could not understand a business which is running in loss as it has more customers it could not accommodate its ticket buyers who purchase ticket 4 month prior to journey. I.e railway is knowing that after 4 months these no of passengers will be travelling still ticket gets cancelled and giving no respect to the customers. And making room for the bribe monster TTE to sell black at exponential rate without giving penny to government.

In my past 30 year train experience I have not seen a good train other than rajdhani and shatabdi. It seems that rajdhani and shatabdi are only trains Indian railway operates with dedication.

Today I am sitting in a heavily crowded train no 12941 and Iwanted to travell from Agra fort to kanpur which is nearly 250 km this is a superfast (nice mockery of the word) train scheduled to depart from AGRA FORT At 1540 hrs and arrive Kanpur central at before 2000hrs it arrived right time and now at 21:30 in six hours my superfast tran any how managed to travel 80 kms from agra fort (I think bicycles move even faster than superfast trains).
"
1,"First of all please remove that express tag from this train. This train suppose to arrive at 9:15 am at pune station but god knows what happen train just stopped 2 km away from pune station for 2 hrs and arrived on station at 11:15 ..again running status shows it will cover further distance fast but alas! This F....ing train slowed down and it took more than 12 hrs to reach belgaum..which usually took 8 hrs by other trains..Why dont u guys change its name to local passenger??...this train keeps standing for hrs and hrs every niw abd then....after searching online reviews this train has highest record of delaying for more than 6 hrs?? without any reason....no other train took this much time...and this is not the first time that this train has been delayed....i will never ever going to travel by indian train again.....very irresponsible staff n service..i will not recommend anyone to go by train..use bus or flight instead....atleast it will save your precious time.
"
3,"Pune hamsafar santragachi express. Although it charge much higher but one of the worst train ever. No attendant, no pants, 6 hours late. Really corruption at its peak. It started from its destination station 2 hour late and apart from covering it is again and again late.
"
2,"Dear IR, Appreciate your effort on providing toilets with tissue paper rolls., however, it would be much better if you can extend the length of chained mugs provided as it won't reach up to butt.

Since we Indians prefer water over anything, a better water facility would be much appreciated.

By the way kudos for improved cleanliness!

1,"Hello friend I am dev and today I will share my real experience about Indian railways with all of you,

Now I am going to tell about IRCTC

mean of IRCTC is Indian railways catering and tourist co-operation ,

It easy to make up who is slept but it most difficult to wake up someone who is acting as if it is slept: - unknown

As far as I know , every organisation are meant to be formed for the smooth public service , in irctc might be helpful in some cases, but true fact that is this governing body really working for the welfare of public in Indian railways, which is having annual profile of more than thousands of crorest every year. I don't want to complain to any people here, because perhaps tha administration system is itself not working or may be it is playing the drama of being unknown about the every incident which is hurting public and inner tourist who are using the railway transport system , while traveling one place of India to another, Perhaps these nights be difficults not only of me alone but the every travellers who had unusual day while traveling from railways,

So now taking about inside railways,

I normally don't know what is the condition in first class compartment but talking about the second class compartment , food is not batter then of good quality, very costly and un-reliable time table of serving food, The first thing that comes in my mind about food is third class and bad quality of tea in 10 rs

Not a single customer takes it from all satisfaction and as a result , we have to take a tea outside catering server when any platform comes because the outer tea is much cheaper with atleast good taste, And lunch, dinner abd other food are not of good quality and perhaps everyone know the quality of lunch and dinner in railways , because there is no other option then going for those food, we have to take those food just for the sake of stomach.

And the MRP of food products is said to be the maximum retailing price of any products in this price the benefits as well as every taxes,

But we won't get any food on mrp rate always the highest rate then of listed tag price,

And they want to more profite in railways by those raised high price,

So all my friends this is my real opinion abot it's.

1,"Hello friends today I want to share my bad experience with Indian railways staff. Last week I want to go to sirhind from kirtpur sahib. I have an option to travel in train.The train schedule was 2: 35 pm. I have reached the railway station on time & bought the ticket. Now I was waiting the train till 3: 30 pm. but the train had not come. Then I go to ticket window ( jnqueary) and ask about 64512 train status. They said me that the railway track repair work has on progress and no any train will come before 5 o'clock. To hear this I feel so sad. If they know about that why did`nt they announced, and why they sold me ticket. I left the railway station and reached sirhind by bus.

1,"I have just cancelled online ticket from pune to kalyan maharashtra. It cost Rs. 75+ service charges 22.90+ bank charges 10 Rs. 108/- in total.

But I get 1000 volt shock when I get cancellation receipt as it shows refund amount of Only Rs. 15/- What a damn.

Its ok that service charges are not refundable. But a huge 80% deduction as a cancellation

fees is absolutely unfair for small people. No one can accept such a huge cancellation fees.

I only had a 75/-+ Rs. ticket . But imagine you have booked rs. 3800/- or more amount of ticket and if you need to cancel the ticket because of some emergency.

Mr. Railway minister please rethink about this huge cancellation fees.
"
2,"20th Feb, 2016. I went to old Delhi Railway station with 5 other members of my family to board Rani Khet express. Unfortunately, Train was cancelled due to JAAT protest. We then went to Anand Vihar Bus terminal to reach our destination by Bus. Waiting since so much days, as someone told me that for cancelled trains u get refund automatically. Today I contacted them and asked for the refund. they say ""THE TAIN WAS NOT CANCELLED"" For Gode Sake ""How can they say so? ""

I am not getting any refund.

1,Delay is the norm of indian railways.Ministry don't understand the valuable time lost by passengers due to indian railways inconsistency schedules.

Ec -1 , in whole train no tv is working no usb is working and amount is very high

Very bad facilities not up to the mark.

1,"I Ised to travel 30 years before and in 2020. The Research & Development done by Indian Railways seems to be failed.

The passengers Can't sleep inside the Sleeper Coach. All trains are being vibrate exorbitantly. Per Second the train vibrate 5 times then how passengers can sleep?

Need to improve lot.

At Europe trains goes at speed of 400kms per hour the passenger can't feel single vibration.

When the Indian Railways will change?

1,One of the foolish Dept in India..not a single work handled by them depsite large number of workers. Not a single train runs on time..it should be bhojpuri railway not Indian railway. They are good at just making people panic. Kuch nahi ata unko ..there women are satisfied always frustrated at public..
1,"1) 3AC - cleanliness - 3 out of 5

2) Toilets - 2 out of 5

3) Food - 0.5 out of 5

Seriously 3AC is also not so clean.

Toilets are dirty.

Food is really bad.

Most of the working staff/ food caterer are chewing guthka and all. They literally spit while they talk or when they're taking order.

I've completed 5 hrs of journey and this is the condition of this train.

Train timing: 1.00 pm from kota (departure)

Cleanliness - Average"
1,My parents booked the Bangalore Mysore Tippy express today on 12/12/2019..the train came at 5.30 pm to Bangalore wen it was supposed to reach by 3.15pm..so much inconvenience...Indian railways should maintain strict discipline about the timings like Other developed countries not causing inconvenience to it's users..Hope the officials and lawmakers give some more thought about it...
3,"At first I thought I was an Elitist Fool who had lost touch with reality of Train Travel. I would better be 'Grounded' !

I tried looking for Seat Numbers in a Premium Train, every where - Seat Itself, Train Wall (so to say) or any other god fores-aken place where it could be found or read ! Look where ??I finally found it ! And I am 6 feet tall ! Are only small children travelling in trains or helping their parents find seat numbers on a train ?

1,"I don't have option to give -10 so I am giving 1 star

Bengaluru Hubli janashatabdi timing is 6.10 but today (26-11-2019) suddenly changed time to 8.30 am, while announcing the even to to told which Jana shathabdi, what is the reason any other option. Then I thought of going in other train (Dadar express) so I went to help desk one more Indian was sitting he nother knew English nor kannada (I don't know how this railway Dept has appointed him) then went to

TT, he told me that I can't travel with Jana Shatabdi ticket. Then I purchased one more ticket for Dadar train.

Compare to Indian government railway our KSRTC (Karnataka state road transport corporation) for better and we have many options."
1,"I just want to say people who think this train tickets are always full and will you be able to travel from coimbatore or go coimbatore..

this train is maximum empty..

Because i had a bad experience with railway.

To loot people our indian railway shows seats full when the train is 30% empty.

shame on indian railway booking system"
1,I am giving one rating as there is no minus rating provided to us worst service trains are always delay. no maintenace no cleanliness of coaches

1,"It is the worst train I have ever travelled. I started from Yeshwanthpur on 21/09/2019. Compartments are not clean. Washrooms are not clean. & There is no water for hand-wash. Some people are slept on the floor , it is very difficult to walk. It is one of the worst ever experience."
1,I travelled on on 6th sep in 12552 train. The train running late by 3hrs.the train running though out andhra is very slow but it is super fast
1,"No proper seating arrangement...Atleast they should see whether there is female or she can seat alone if the Male with her is 4 coach back...this much sense must be there...if train is moving towards Mumbai seats are located towards Madgaon....they must think about this that female and Male together are there so seats must be together.
"
1,"First of all , No appropriate and proper booking system available. Travellers are very much struggling due to the non availability of reserved coaches in all trains.Though you have booked SL and AC that also won't get confirmed when chart preparation. Need more seat availability and more coaches of unreserved compartments."
3,Ruthless and currupt handling of this public service this network never operat any task at time they just check the patience of passengers.
3,"I had been to Yeshwantpur Jn Railway Station yesterday/15.07.2019 morning to drop my mother travelling by Yeshwantpur - Bikaner Express train no 14805.

Although the train starts from Yeshwantpur Jn, Bangalore only there was no announcement or display on TV screen as to on which platform the train will come. On asking at Railway Inquiry at the station was informed either platform 4 or 5. So me with my 74 years aged mother went & were waiting on platform 4. Suddenly there was announcement @ 10.30 am the time of departure that now train will come at platform 3. Everyone started running to platform 3.

Finally train arrived at 10.45am on platform 3 & hurriedly departed at 10.55am. Means railway gave hard paying travellers/ customers just 10 minutes to board the train who were waiting at the station for 60-90 minutes. The most funniest part is train was stationed at Yeshwantpur since 8am. Gross mis management."
2,"The worst thing about this train is it's TIME, never punctual, always 2/5 hours delay, plus toilets and traveling experience is very bad.

I suggest travellers to take another train."
3,"I had train at 10 pm was late by 1 hour 30 minutes, we reached the station accordingly. Then they informed 10 minutes before the expected arrival time that the train is late by 3 hours 30 minutes we still managed to wait. Just 5 minutes before 1:30 am they told that it is late by 4 hours now. I mean what the hell is going on? Do they have any kind of management? They must know the value of time and punctuality. Highly disappointed. Government should work on this first instead of messing into irrelevant issues. Worst thing i have ever experienced in life.
"
1,This is the worst train...in this train we are not travelling we are suffering....This nonsense train stops anywhere without any reason so long......I'm requesting you please don't travel in this nonsense train otherwise you will cry like me !!
1,"Kabad train, 2 rupay ki aukat nhi h iss train ki....always late after Dabra junction giving pass to every other train, even the passenger train from AGC will take you to NZM earlier than this 3rd class train which takes minimum half an hour to reach RKM from AGC(4km apart) ."
1,Must be the next to the worst train......I have ever seen.......If you want to see anyone wasting your plans and ambitions...you can find it in this train.....The train is regularly three to four hours late everyday.......Despite it's importance and passenger crowd it's always denied the opportunity to cross the line first.....it's also halts on no man stations for a long time
1,"02151 pune kazipet special summer train is not on time, its late by 5 hours, i traveled by it on 6th may.it planned to reach at 10:30 morning in badnera but i reached at 4 in afternoon. Horrible experience in such may heat.schedule of such summer special train should be proper.

1,"It was worst experience people with waiting ticket make the sleeper as general coach TT s are selling tickets in sleeper coaches even no space for stand up properly

2,"I book general ticket from Lumding to newhaflong on 18 April 2019 for the night arrive train. it cost Rs 250 for four people But the booking counter guy charged me Rs 300. He was so damn rude neither speak English nor Hindi apart from local. the two star rating above is for the train which is much more hygiene then the previous years. those staff were working hard. they love their job appreciate it. now, can somebody tell me, does Indian railway charge commission for the general ticket sir.
"
3,"Since last 6-7 years I have been a regular passenger in 18464 prashanti express but it's never on time ever.

Is there any special order for this train to get late Everytime??

Even if it's late by 10 minutes( initially) it will make it 30 min to 1 hr late while reaching destination."
1,Totally waste train. General ticket people all are in sleeper coach. We cant able to go in and out. Full coach and even there is no single space in the train everywhere all are sitting without reservation.i felt why i booked this train. No ttr is coming for checking. No Clean no hygiene.
1,Rail department need to manage the the proper schedule for all the locals while any mail is coming... because most of the time because of the mails lregular local train get delayed and we are not even allowed to take the mail even though the destination is same and we also have the ticket.....please it become very inconvenient when it’s emergency... Either follow the proper schedule or allow the ppl to travel by mail (fir those who have tickets)..... because nobody can waste their half and hour one hour everyday..... and please hire some decent staff who will have the basic manners..... atleast on emergency time..... and obviously if the person have the ticket means he is not thief of travelling for free..... The rail staff literally treat the traveler as a crime suspect and threatened for jail and chargsheet....It looks like the agenda is only to make money...... Rail staff really need to arrange some lectures on manners and behaviour.....and PLEASE understand WE ARE PAYING FOR THE TRAVEL..... WE ARE NOT TRAVELLING FOR FREE.... SO LEARN TO TREAT WELL....
1,"The only thing that I want to tell here is that Indian Railways have no any punctuality. I was about to get in the Kerala Express train on 25th February Monday morning 11 am but, it reached on my station warangal at only 3:30pm. Why the railway authorities never give any value to the people, their time. Such a horrible experience that I have ever had and this is why most of the people hate travelling by train. Because of the lack of punctuality and time"
1,"The trains in India are never on time. These are the worst railways anyone can ever see. I can bet that no one in the world would ever like Indian trains. These trains are only bringing bad name to our country. The trains are never on time but the fines are as if No trains can be better than these shits. I advise never to trust the Indian Railways. These trains are contributing their best to India being called a poor nation. Shame on Indian Railway Services

1,I have a really bad experience with the railways i nd my friend we were really treated bad in the ladies compartment by a female officialwe bymistakely climbed in the 1st class compartment she literally was treating us like wea re taking her money nd running awaythe behaviour was quite rude toward us

1,This train starts from Santragachi (Kolkata) to (Pondicherry) train number 06009. It has a record of getting late atleast by 5 hours. It was delayed from the starting junction by over 3 hours. I strongly recommend people to not travel from this train ever. And Indian railways is always in dump.
1,"I am writing this review resting on the upper birth compartment of the same train. Time is now 11:41 and train has reached itarsi. I am a regular Traveller in Indian railways and this is the first time I am writing a review out of anger. This train has only Ac compartments and has a good interior design.. But this is the worst maintained train I has seen. Its been almost 18 hours of traveling and this train hasn't been cleaned once! no cleaning staffs available.. and the coach attender is a youngster with a rough attitude like he is the owner of the train or something.. and 10 minutes before I went to toilet and I saw potty on the footrest of Indian closet and I was wondering is there anything worst to see before a good night sleep. And train charging ports won't be on throughout the journey. And to top up all the miseries I ordered a non veg thaali from apna foods which is a private catering service and to be frank even a dog would say 'Na' to that roti with 80% aata and 20 % crap ( No wheat I guess). I suggest all those who are reading this review to avoid this train if u want a good journey or if u fantasize to step on potty in a footrest u can go forward ... No offense. This review is 100 percentage true to my knowledge and experience.

1,"Sincerely saying we normal people depends on railways and the

railway authority(tt and rpf) is misusing their powers.

I reserved through Irctc online got waiting list within 30 boarded train in the middle of night for a long journey which is actually not a trip but for a urgent purpose( for attending a competitive exam)

Since I am in waiting list I searched for tt in many compartment but couldn't found him .so I waited till he arrives in my place

Later he arrived without giving any chance he said the ticket is cancelled.and asked me to leave in the next station .

But what I found is that if I was supposed to give him some hand money he may allow me to accommodate in any berth.since many others who don't even reserved and with normal tickets is allowed to get berth. By paying him .the rpf too is getting a portion of this corrupt money .And they are using rpf to treat accidentall victims like me in a bad way I don't understand then what is the purpose of booking some 10 days before and paying some bucks earlier. And literally we can't get in general compartments during night time every one knows the situation .and how many general compartments we have in such trains and time .we can't even have a place for our legs .in general compartments .

And at last what happened I was kicked out in an unknown station in the middle of night. We have heard stories like the British iltreating our ancestors but the very same people is doing the same .

First we have to treat our people in better way then only there is requirement to treat foreigners .better .and paying crores to film stars for athithi devo Bhava adds .

I really appreciate indian railways electrification and the bio toilets but the way our uniform forces in railway treating people is like the people are their servants .

Without increasing the general compartments how can we accommodate these many people and how they are supposed to say us to get in general compartments where there is no space for even for a pin ."
3,"Cricket and Indian railway, both are created to halt the advancement of Indians.Indian railway is the worst transportation which never value its customers time.and most of the the staffs at the ticket counter have no clue what customer service is.the hygeine and cleanliness of the train is more because of the attitude of the customers."
1,"Its my first and last time in IndianRailway such a wastage of Time and money

They announce train going to start. But train started at 5: 25 am. No one maintaining time. Indian Railway 's. I people's have ticket or not we are checking. First u guys are properly working or not check it.
3,"F* railway system. Y idiot officers can't listen on passanger trains. Y passenger train peoples not giving money . maintain passenger trains at correct time. Waiting 3 hours in train till not started from starting

all system. Officers all go and die in front of train

1,"Rajdhani express from Nizt to Bangalore on September 4. Food was extremely bad, Western toilet didn't have flush out. No coffee served at Bangalore. No soup served. We were in births 1 and 4. It was flooded with flies and mosquitoes as the catering arrangements are done at outside toilet. Sai catering is the contractor who makes a lot of money. Someone in railways is receiving bribe. They didn't care passengers. Very poor quality of food. We both are sick. Please avoid Rajdhani express. Food is not at all good. Very disappointing experience. They charge RS.1000 more for food. Food is not worth even 200. Coffee is not served in flask.

1,"Worst train I travelled ever, No hygiene, No Punctuality( 6 hours journey took 12 hours), the worst facility, No water in washrooms and dirty wash basin and washrooms

Thanks to IR

Bullshit ."
1,I am travelling from mumbai to mughalsarai. its very worst experience in my life train is 5 hour late. indian government really dont care and dont value of his people. In future I ll not prefer in Indian railways again. its totally waste of time and bulshitt. shame please provide us some good quality of journey and care about the people time.
1,"Please never book these 2 trains it never run on time and run late mostly by 10 hrs. Unfortunatel I booked my round trip in same train but deceived twice by more 26 hrs just of running late in 2 days journey.

1,Very very bad facilities in seat cleaning. Train no. 12456 BIKANER TO DELHI SARAI ROHILLA TRAIN. I HAVE BOOKING 8 SEATS FROM SANGRUR TO DELHI BUT. EVERY SEATS IS VERY BAD CONDITIONS. DUE TO DUST. I CLEANED EVERY SEAT WITH MY HAND. VERY SHAMEFUL TO INDIAN RAILWAY.
1,The trains are always late. Sometimes even 24-26 hours. The management always fails to give the right and deserving service. The substitution of delayed trains are also poor. Waiting rooms are not big enough to give the passengers adequate amount to even sit. In one word. Indian Railways SUCKS!
1,"Bad service provided, They were coakroaches inside a two tier ac compartment in sbc kacheguda express.Compartment was damn stincky.The train was late for 2 hours.I would like to request the authority to ensure that Cleaniness should be maintained.It was a big problem for senior citizens."
1,"This so called special train, MAS-SRC AC Special Express(02842) did not even have average facilities like pantry car, clean toilets.

Apart from that, the wires were coming out from the wire cabinets of AC coaches. Also, the train was delayed by 2.5 hours with no specific stoppage time in a station. Sometimes it gave a 10min stop in Vizag and 2 min stop in Vijayawada. Also, as it was special train se couldn't order from outside as the outside vendors wouldn't take our order.

Very pathetic journey experience with IRCTC, which is not my usual experience with it.

cheating no.1 - it does not have LHB coaches.

cheating no.2 - Average speed is 63kmph. wastes your time.

It is completely showing the cheating nature of our greatest indian railways & South central railway.

They are simply running a normal superfast train with dynamic pricing and charging more fares from the people.

if private organisations cheat the poeple, they go to government, but what they do if government itself is cheating?

it is completely ridiculous.

Please dont board this train.

Secondly it's waiting time is even worser than that of local ones

No pantry

1,"I m writing this with the sense of frustration that m facing with indian railway

Never will you ever get ticket in any long distance train even if you booked it for months

India has this huge population and over half of population depends on railways but our government do not pay any attention to passengers condition of traveling.

Regret / NA/ WL always.

I m personally very frustrated with this situation of indian railway.

And trains never reach on time not even a single train in long distance traveling.

I think our government should take this seriously.

Hopefully it will change.

Thankyou.

No matter in which class you travel, thay will make your condition pathetic by halting at unusual places where the passengers will die in hunger.

I frequently travel every part in UP and also to Delhi.I don't know why it's too hard for IR to maintain the punctuality. And the funny part is Indian govt. Is talking about the introduction of bullet trains in India .

Seriously .Mera desh mahaan!

1,"Never ever a train reaches on time. they are just looting the poor and middle class person.no cleaning in train compartment or in toilet. 90% train have very old coaches suitable for transferring only luggages. only providing wifi and other name sake facilities and keeping eye off from the real issues is not going to help common people in any way.Mr.prabhu should first ensure clean food, compartments, toilets, hassle free reservations and on time running of trains so that people get beniffted in reality. indian railway sucks!"
1,"This train is delayed by 12-15 hours daily and no one even cares. The train is not even cleaned before boarding for the next journey. The coach c-16 is in a extremely bad shape. Why this injustice with only a few passengers. The seats are greased, the walls are dirty and there are rats roaming. Please don't travel by this train."
1,"It is with a sense of frustration that I write this:

Even after nearly 70 years after independence, it is a shame that the demand for seats for travel by trains outstrips what the railways offers. Even though we resort to advance reservations, many times, the seats just do not get confirmed.

And, not all can plan their trips months in advance in order to adjust to the inability of railways to meet the needs of passengers. I dream of the day when I can take a long distance train journey without reserving a seat for any class of seat. Hopefully, something will change. Thank you.

On 3rd May 2015 I started my journey from BAM to SALEM. This was a horrorful story. I had the reservation in sleeper class but I got my seat in 2 hours. There were as many as 30 people in 8 seats. People were everywhere even in the bathroom. I didn't drink water fearing having to go to bathroom.

This year when we were of going to Delhi by Raajdhani Express in after noon they served mazza but when on 27th of April we were returning to Bangalore they have not served any thing between breakfast and lunch. At Tea time they have given a stinking sandwich.

There is no pre set slandered for food and it all depends on your luck that whether you are going to get edible food or not. We have paid huge amount as a freight and we got this.Not at all satisfied with services offered during travel."
1,"Recently, I traveled by two Shatabdi trains i.e. Delhi-Kalka Shatabdi(7.40AM) and Ludhiana -Delhi Shatabdi(4.40 pm).

Delhi Kalka shatabdi gives sudden jerks while at high speed, causing a lot of problem to those having spine problems( my case), and also otherwise, to everyone. The problem was reported by me many years back also by me but I think that suggestions and complaints just find their way to dustbins. Traveler's comfort is the last thing Indian Railways cares for.

Ludhiana -Delhi shatabdi was my first experience so far and it was worse and horrible. In executive class compartment, It felt like sitting on a tractor trolley on a rough road! . To add to this was fermented & foul smelling rice served in dinner, which confirmed my faith in press reports of Railway Kitchens.

I would suggest the authorities to take a serious note of track conditions and suspensions of   railcars. On food quality, it seems rather impossible to resolve quality issue and the only solution seems is scrapping food service by IRCTC kitchens and making arrangements for availability of food services of reputed private players in the field."
3,"I tried to book a railway ticket today at 08:00 am from BPL to CAN. But at 07:59 AM, to my surprise, found that only 4(four) tickets were availabe on General Quota.

What happened to the other seats? Certainly, it would have been added into Tatkal? or Premium Tatkal?.  This is nothing but eating into the aam-aadmis quota to provide for tatkal.

How can I plan my travel in advance, in such a case?.

I would therefore suggest that part of the Tatkaal quota(at a rate equivalent to Tatkaal Rate plus Rs. x) be left open two or four months in advance wherein only 50% of the amount be refunded on cancellation."

1,"After paying premium fees the expectation of any passenger would be bit more.

But believe us, after travelling in 02509 on 19/12/2014, hardly anyone dared to travel in so called premium, trains.

a) Late start up @ source station, no updates for 2 morpheushumanurs.

b) Very bad hygienic condmajeechaons in toilet and coach.

c) AC not functioning properly & even doors are closed.

d) Bad food.

2,"I recently traveled by the New Delhi - Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani express from New Delhi to Tatanagar. The breakfast served was horrible. The ""Meals on Wheels"" menu clearly mentioned that the Omlette should be 2 eggs.served with Fries and Boiled veg. However what they serve is not even made of one egg. There were no fries and only five boiled peas.

These shameless people then move around with a tray asking for TIPS before you reach your destination.

Hope the new Government and the Minister take immediate steps to stop corruption in the Railway Catering.This is a request to all fellow passengers to report such things immediately and raise your voice against the staff who cheat passengers. They have become arrogant and think they can keep doing this and get away.

1,"I am not discouraging or talking about the negative aspects. But since its economical it doesn't mean we should get poor service or quality. NEEDS A MAJOR CHANGE to get things improved as we are becoming a developed country. The quality of seats and a clean toilets needs to be the most important things that  definitely needs to be improved

5,"I have seen many people discussing about the good and bad things about our Indian railways. Apart from that, I would like to inform you that how we can make use of the railway network to the best to benefit ourselves?"
1,"The South Central Railway is testing the patience of its passengers.  Every day several express trains halt at Moulali or at the outer of Secunderabad Railway station just for want of vacant platform.  I have traveled by Duranto express from Vizag to Secunderabad on 2.1.2014.  The train is supposed to reach Secunderabad by 8:00 AM, the train run late by 15 mts and reached Moulali and to my surprise it stopped at Moulali for more than One and half hours.

Meanwhile the Garib Rath and other trains are allowed but Duranto made to wait.  Some passengers got down at Moulali and left for their destinations.  One can imagine the carelessness of the management of SC railway in maintaining the time schedule of such important trains.  After getting down at Secunderabad at 10:10 AM just I have inquired some porters(They are better than the babus at senior level) they have told that trains are detained on the platforms for more time resulting in abnormal delays.

Will the Railway authorities wake up and do something?"
1,"Indian railway service are worst Every time the announcement are; train is coming, it's on platform. From last 4 hrs. Any time every where stops. They don't care about the passenger. It's just irritating. This train is from Patna to Asansol special. Train no. 03512, date-17th Nov 2013."
1,"Recently, I travelled by Rajdhani express from New Delhi to Bangalore. I had to travel by train as the air tickets had become really expensive and my travel was planned at the last moment.

While the train facilities and services were usual - dirty and inefficient, what shocked me most was the behaviour of catering staff. As you would be aware, the catering services on Indian trains are not known for great quality, taste or hygiene. However, what I found unusual was the fact that the catering staff was almost forcibly collecting Rs.100 from each passenger.

Towards the end of the journey, the catering staff came to my seat and started flashing some 100 rupee notes. When I looked around, I found people handing over Rs.100 notes to them. Then he told me - sir, you also have to give money. When I told him that I have already paid money to Indian Railways, he made a strange face and told me that he is expecting money for the ""excellent service"" that he provided.

I refused to pay him money. When he was about to serve morning tea, he deliberately didn't serve me tea. When I asked him, he told me to walk to Pantry Car to get the tea.

This episode has left me totally shocked. In Indian Railways, now people feel that getting a tip is their birthright."
1,"I have made several trips by Rajdhani and Duronto Express trains from Hyderabad to Bangalore and Delhi. Let me tell you that all my experiences have been awful.

Once when I was travelling to B'lore, the train was expected to reach by 6 a.m. but it reached 4 hours late. As per rules we were to be served breakfast and the catering staff kept telling us that the breakfast was getting ready but finally just before reaching the station we were informed that no breakfast would be served. Secondly, whenever I have traveled by Duronto train, I have never been served cold drinking water or cold frooti. It is always warm and undrinkable.

The waiters have the audacity to suggest keeping the drink for a while in AC to let it cool. Once the poories served for lunch were just rotten. Another time we were served only 3 non-vegetarian plates against 4 and the fourth one was veg. Whenever I ask for complaint book, the waiters start pleading and promise to exchange the warm bottle or say that they would provide extra rice against poories and disappear for some time.

The greatest problem is that no other passenger is willing to complain(seems they all travel on free ticket of Govt or company). So the best thing for me is to stop travelling by these trains and travel with my home made food in some other train."
1,"First Things First is one needs to be real lucky to get into the rail, due to so many issues of getting the ticket:

The website irctc.co.in is static at all times..and the page expires as you type...winning the Lottery would be an easier task I guess.

the website needs to update itself and I don't know the details but it should have more servers to facilitate proper access to all people.

the booking counters should ensure proper delivery of tickets and should not have complaints of

"" Line nahi hai"" ( the connection to the servers is down). it makes it impossible to get Tatkal tickets.

Please give some importance to human life and security and ensure proper public amenities at all places.

proper disaster management drills and safety measure at the stations as well as the trains also.

hiking the fare is not the only solution...

I hope I am heard...."

4,"Every time I board a train I have a new and wonderful experience despite the fear and troubles (which almost always are). yes, there are discrepancies in the system compared to that of the developed countries but we can't just complain. Can we? last time I boarded a train was yesterday from delhi to varanasi by shivganga in ac 3 tier. firstly excellent e ticketing facility. for one thing indian railways is laudable. IRCTC has done great job till now.talking about the journey,  the train was immaculate, toilets were clean too. seat was comfortable and can't complain about covers and mattress. and add to that it reached only half an hour late.

For a govt. corporation and the second largest employer in the world it's a commendable job. let's just not complain. we must see it ourselves too that things are in order and shape. do we keep the toilet seat clean ? do we not spit any where except the spittoons (don't say there aren't any). don't we pull the chain unnecessarily. don't we sometimes travel without ticket and bribe the TT our own way. don't we throw wrappers everywhere to make it look colorful. don't we play loud music inside the train. forget robbery, rape and murder and obviously throwing people out of the train. and the last but definitely not the least staring at women and foreigners. train is one of the cheapest and simpler mode of transport. I wont say safest. only if we control and check ourselves. don't ask me how."
3,"Indian Railways is currently in a very bad financial crisis.  How the Private Companies can come in and help the current Indian Railways Condition?

They were criticized on various reasons like time delay, unhygienic toilets inside the trains and in Railway stations, and the major reason being the accidents that kill thousands of people every year. Can the private players come in and revive the Railways Industry?
"
2,"It is high time the Indian Railways is upgraded.  The condition of the sleeper class as well as III ac coaches are pathetic. In sleeper class the toilets are stinking and not maintained at all. The condition of most of coaches are deplorable.

There is no public address in the train. If the trains are running late the passengers are unaware of it. Some of the coaches have neon lights that are not functioning.

Lack of basic amenities, clean coaches have to attended to immediately. Our politicians are against fare hike but that does not mean the traveling public have to suffer and travel in unclean coaches.

Indian railways one of the biggest railways catering to lakhs of commuters everyday. In a era of modernization,  it is high time the coach conditions are improved,"
2,"Yesterday I travelled by the Chalukya Express. Due to last minute booking I had to travel by the sleeper Class. I boarded the train from Hubli. At this station , I was taken back by the way people were cleaning the toilet and the surrounding area. It was really a wonderful job which needs to be greatly praised. As the train was leaving they all lined up on the platform and waved to the passengers.

apur delhi non stop super fast special..

i had not been able to sleep properly this night .. one of the reason being I had set an alarm to get up early.. I dont know why this happens but it happens .. you cant sleep specially when you have to getup early.. at 2.30 am my phone had started ringing.. I though it was the alarm but it was not..

it may have been a bad coincidence.. someone who had called twice the previous day and was asking for someone I didnt know had called again in the night.. he didnt say anything and I couldnot for a while understand what was going on..but I disconnected the phone after a while ..but I was afraid he would call again .. but luckylee he did not call again.. but I could not sleep..

i got out of bed at 4.30 the train was scheduled to leave at 6 am..

i made it in time..

i found my seat .. no 9 in coach d2 second sitting..

sitting infront of me was a curious 20 or so boy..

another boy aroud 22 or so came. the zipper of his trouser was wide open.. but I ignored.. I am mostly an intovert by nature..

The boy sitting opposite me was wearing a t shirt that read .. your attitude may hurt me..

but my attitude will definately kill you..

he was was already noticing my cago pants and my stylish bag .. stuff I had only out of chance and not out of choice.. and he was dying out of insecurity..but he stood his ground and started talking with other passengers..

2 ticket checkers came .. they cought hold of a person who had boarded the wrong train.. he had to go to Gwalior ..he had the tickes. I or two more people gathered to understand the situation.. the curious guy also jumped upon the oppurtunity..the ticket checkers threatned the person and told him that he will be treated as without ticket.. mean while I noticed the other passengers feeling insecure because the curious guy had left his briefcase unattended as he had followed the ticket checkers to the next bogy.

he came back after a while and told me that they took 1000 bucks from him for boarding the wrong train.

and he will also have to suffer other pain caused by being in delhi instead of gwalior.. he will have to find another train from delhi to gwalior..

i didnot say anything and just smiled.

the he moved on to the fat guy with opened zip and said .""ise band kar lo ye public place hai bhai.""

the poor fello had no answer, was embarrassed and zipped himself..

5,"Since childhood I have been travelling in Indian Railways & I am a proud INDIAN today to see the progress it has made in the recent past. Here are some facts & figures which should be looked upon before starting the review.

Indian Railways provide means of livelyhood to 17 lakhs people directly.

It has the largest network in the world.

Daily 2 crore people of India make use of the railways.

It has got the best safety recordper person .

New Delhi railway station is the largest interlocking And signalling system in world.

Thats enough for now lets start with the review process:-

Trains:- It has trains running since 1853 .With its rich heritage and history which one can see if he or she pays a visit to the railway museum located in new delhi.Presently it has broad gauge,meter gauge & narrow gauge trains running in its vast network.

Connectivity:- If one wants to see the real india then he should travel by trains as it has huge network and connects every nook & corner of the country.

Service:- The frequency of the trains is upto the mark & one can get his tickets booked through online website/travel agents/ticket booking counters. Urgent travel is required then one also has the option of Tatkal reservation.

Benefits:- No other train service offers concessions to so many categories of people in the world as it is offered in India. Chronically ill gets to travel at fraction of the costs,students too can get discounts,doctors are eligible for 10 percent discounts.Senior citizens,national award winners,handicapped peoples the list is endless. This makes travelling in indian railways truely an amazing & value for money experience.

Stations:- Indian railways has more than 7000railway stations. One has the facility of toilets & drinking water avaliable at the stations.Upkeep of these stations do require a bit more effort but surely the conditions have improved a lot .There are air conditioned waiting rooms,rail yatri niwas facility,low budget hotels like ginger nereby & food and beverages are avaliable 24 hrs at the main junctions.

Ticketing & Refunding:- Many times people complain of tickets being unavaliable or they have not got the refund amount.This is obvious as there are conditions which are out of control to be managed like fog weather ,political rallies,naxal & maoists terror activities. Although steps have been taken to keep a close watch & increasing the security at areas effected .Furthur ,GPS navigation trials are on fast track to avoid delays by fog and one can run trains by keeping in touch with the sat navigation.Refund request should be presented atleast 2 hours before the departure of the train.A nominal processing fee is deducted and rest of the amount is refunded in cash.Online tickets can also be cancelled at the click of the mouse & refund amount can be seen in monthly bank statements.

Accidents:- A policy is in place for the injured & people who get killed in an accident caused by railways.

Monetary compensation is awarded to the family members of the decesed & free health services to those who are injured.Compensation can be obtained by providing the proof of travel by the train met with accident with identification proof.ACDthat stands for anti collosion device which is at a pilot stage of testing in one of the zones of the railways.Soon it will be installed in all engines of the indian railways.

Areas of improvements:-

1) Faster trains should be started.Presently the top speed is around 140 km/hr. Talks are on with japanese consultancy to set up rapid rail networks with much faster intercity travel.

2) Freight corridorsneed to be set up so as to delineate the passenger & freight traffic thereby increasing the operational capability of the railways.

3) Clean stations & clean toiletsin trains should be at the top of the priority list for the railways.Furthur passengers need to be educated about the importance of hygeine.

4)Toilet dischargeshould be collected in a tank inside the compartment & later cleaned at the servicing bays .

5) GRP that stands for govt railway police the agency incharge for protecting the railway property from anti social elements.Guards should be there in every train & x-ray luggage scanners should be installed in sensitive locations which are prone to terror attack

6)Law should be made so as to limit the luggage allowed per person so as to make people realize that one should always travel with minimum amount of luggage so as to avoid inconvenience to others.

7) Timely running of the trains will pull back the passengers who have shifted to low costs airlines.DGCA is an incompetent authority who has allowed untrained & fake license holders pilots to fly passenger jets in indian skies without necessary skills .Disaster can happen anytime.But Indian railways has a policy to take exams of the candidates who wants to be a driver

medically he checked and given fittness certificate after rigrous training only he is handed over the control of a passenger train.

Verdict:- Much more can be written about Indian railways and I have so many special memories related to my travelling experiences in railways.Wheather its travellin in engine of a toy train in himalayan ranges or taking a lift from the guard of a freight train .....One just cant experience the incredible india without giving a miss to indian railways.....Hats off to employees of Indian Railways for making it work......

3,"I was travelling from Allahabad to Haridwar in link express 2A class as on 02 Nov 2010. On 3rd morning the train is late by 5 hours. When I was about to reach Haridwar I came near to gate and I noticed that Mr Kapoor (ticket checker) is smoking. Then my eyes caught the attention of the notice just next to this man 'Rs 200 penalty for smoking in the train'

I took my mobile and catch this moment in my camera. Enclosed the snap of SMOKING TICKET CHECKER MR KAPOOR IN THE TRAIN.

I request railway department to improve services and make sure that staff should not break the rule. This is very common but the common man suffer because of the monotony of such ticket checker."
3,"I have reached Chennai in Kaveri Express from Bangalore ( Krishnarajapuram Station ). Little did I realize that I need to check the coach status as my ticket was an RAC one & my wrist watch was showing a time beyond the rialway portal work time ( 2330 they close the show.. not just the booking but also the reservation status pages.. funny though)... I SMSed my PNR to the service number and got a message saying the service isnt available after 23.30. I thought that was an automated service..Aint it??? But it doesnt sound like one from the message I got....

Ok.. Lucky for me that this train has numerous stations to stop before arriving at Chennai and even if I land in the wrong coach, I can walk through to my right coach guided by His Highness The TTE of Southern / South Western Railway who only do their work using their subconscious mind. Well dont ask what their concious mind is doing... Thats continously checking on possibilities of selling empty berths unofficially... and making quick money...( A lot of them do )

To make things easier for me, I boarded one of the reserved coaches in the centre of the train and I was very happy that the TTE took an instant look at my ticket and without checking the charts requested me to board one of the first three coaches from engine ( S12, 13 or 14 ). I applied my analytic mind again and got into the middle coach so that I less through the coach as people would be still busy settling down. The TTE took one look at the ticket and while mind was racing that he should say one of the three numbers... there was another googled and the number was S11. My next question was if the train has continuous vestibule and the instant look of TTE was "" Which world are you in.

All coaches are connected ""... So there I started walking and after one coach there was one big shutter on which I could see something written on Font size 80 "" VINOTH YOUR SLEEP IS SCREWED"" . It was half past midnight.. Still I didn't give up and knew the train would stop in the next five minutes at Whitefield station and was ready to run a marathon as S11 was the last coach. True it wasnt the best day of mine) and while I was ready for the marathon standing near the door while the train was pulling into Whitefiled station, the guy on the upper berth close to where I was standing with his half open eye, asked me close the door once I get down. I couldn't help him as I would be late. There I started running and every coach had its door locked. I thought for a moment that it was time for me to take a rick and head back home as I ran beyond S11 and couldn't find any of the coaches open.. Finally after rock banging I could manage entry after the train started moving.

I enter S11 and there is my berth number 32, Side Lower berth a very tough one for a six footer, , But I was too tired, that even a 4 feet berth could have sung a lullaby for me... But looked like my berth was auctioned at a premium rate and I found that out as the TTE openly told me that he sold my berth and also took money ( absolutely unofficial and he was telling me that and asked me why I was late ). Neither in my home, school or in work place has anyone asked me that.. But it doesnt matter as I wanted to hit the berth for that 4 hour sleep... and was given a Side Upper. More luxury and u know whats the iciing on the cake, that was right next to the toilet and u can imagine.

170 bucks for overnight journey. No country can boast of this price... I am happy with that and very proud as well. However the basic amenities and support at stations is something which is very important... and the budget should talk about these stuffs and not just people or ministers or government should boast of the cost not being cut. Definitely we respect that but there are more to that money money. I don't have much trust in Mamta's budget but I wish some good minister comes for the next year atleast and bring in an ocean change in the way railways work and provides services.

The worst berth that can be allotted to you is a Side Upper and if you are a tall guy thats like the biggest punishment of your life. And if your number reads 8 or 72 the one right next to the Toilets, man you are dead.... So what I suggest is if you happen to get one of those numbers as your Berth please ensure you wear yourself out during the day so that you can sleep on any condition during the night..

Have a lucky journey"

1,"I want to share a bad experience which my parents suffered while travelling in first AC compartment of the indian railways...they were travelling from habibganj to umaria..the curtains were torn...the compartment was smelling of foul smell. the bathroom seats too were broken.

They could not sleep the whole night of the stench...they did complain to the railway supervisor who expressed his helplessness..finally they wrote in the complaint book and are awaiting response from any of the railway official...they took photographs of the compartment which is a must see.

The railways do charge quite a bit for the first AC and it is supposed to be actually good...such experiences naturally bring down the reputation of the railways...or is it because this was a lesser known route.........if a complaint has been lodged isnt it the duty of any responsible railway official to redress and address the wrong................

3,"Indian railways is lifeline for entire indian population that is 10200 million.The population of australia is just 20 million and indian population is more than 50 times of australia and same if u think of canada both the country are three times bigger than india.

Population wise we have rank but matching facility of raillink is lacking and need to be doubled everywhere. Passengers have to sit like animals if u travel in any ordinary compartment. I am used to travel in compartments where the very entry becomes a circus, many invent ideas as follows.

1 Enter the platform hours before the arrival of the impending train.

2 que for ticket hours before the train arrival.

3 whole family members make several way to find seat and invent novel method by spreading

bedsheets, news paper and even their suit cases and ofcourse the upper luggage place is mostly

are occupied by sleeping and if it is heavy rush sometimes six to eight persons sit and risk.

He who is used to travel in such animal compartment has better suggestion.

The right time has come for railways to increase the facility for every indian citizen to travel decently just because come what may, train journey is most safe and cheaper hence including me

calculate saving money instead of comfort.

THERE IS NEED TO DECONGEST THE RUSH.

Yes I am sure railway department officials who travel in ac cars, in highest luxury cant make out

how it is like travelling in animal compartment.There is absolute no comfort and one has to endure

sleeplessness, fatigue and hunger too.

I HAD TO EAT TEN TIMES BECAUSE OF FATIGUE IN THE JOURNEY.

Yes since u have to sit in a tight conditon u become more humane and forget the pain of it.friends

before we sit in the train we curse the rush and uncomfortable sitting postion where even to change

your sitting postion is a herculean job but u find god lives here.

I REALLY LOVE THE WAY FAMILIES SHARE THEIR SMILE IN POVERTY.

Yes they are so poor, but their heart is so pure, sometimes I get tears seeing their misery because

when I am eating the poor child look in such a kind pitiable way, how can I eat, so I try to give as much as possible that I have.

IF U GIVE EATABLES THE POOR REALLY ACCEPT IT WITH GRATITUDE.

U may donate a lot, but when u share what u eat and drink, the poor really give u so much respect

then I wish oh god please also make me as poor as them, so when some kind man or woman

gives me food or coffee it will taste so delicious.

U HAVE TO SLEEP IN DISCOMFORT BUT EACH KNOWS HOW BAD IT IS.

In indian railway travel especially ordinary compartment is less equipped with any modern facility, most of the time toilet has less water but stunning news I give.

INSPITE OF RUSH THE TOILET IS REALLY NOT DIRTY GOD CLEANS IT.

This I am amazed to say, freinds most of the compartments of ordinary I have travelled too much rush it may be, but somehow people know how not to dirty the toilet, many times I find ordinary

sleeper has far less cleanliness than cattle compartment this is news really.

now coming back what is needed major surgery for railways.

1 Delhi should have double track to each state capital a direct link so that time is saved.

example delhi to bangalore let them make double track , similarly delhi to bombay double track, hence in this way nearly 15 double track may be needed and total land needed will be just many few thousands acres of land, but if u compare land usage for road highways railway lines

need just 30 ft for each track.

IF U DOUBLE THE TRACKLINE U NEED JUST 60 FT ONLY.

compared to double track line, roads need four times to five times the space needed for railway.

2 Train journey is safe it is universal truth hence.

History of indian railways.

Britishers introduced railway service for india, and main reason to introduce was for their administrative purpose otherwise road transport was fair weather basis and since the transport vehicles was not much there at all.

well what the britishers gave to india one is english and second is railway has given greatest strength for indian economy and it is very easy to visit any place starting from kanyakumari to delhi in two days time, and so economically .

WHOLE FAMILY CAN TRAVEL ALONG WITH FOOD PACKED.

Imagine a middle class family of five persons including children they pack food for three days travel and u can see it in long journey travellers, ur mouth get watered when they eat and u feel oh I should have also brought food likewise.

IT IS TIME GOVT SPEND AT LEAST ONE LAKH CRORE RUPEES FOR MANY PURPOSE.

Every district head quarter should have a well facilitated station with all amentities including rooms, hotel, shopping complexes and also internet facility, the reason of this need is tourist will feel safe to stay at railway station premises and their safety, saving of money and also they can roam the city they stay with ease. This one lakh crore rupees is just 1000 rs for each indian citizen. In a period of two years railway can make this much profit and we dont need income tax to be paid at all, i am sure our government can run just by the revenue .

1,"The quality of the customer service cell of irctc is simply disgusting. I just typed out a letter to the authorities ( which I have very little hope of being attended to ).

The customer care numbers are either dysfunctional, or not attended or busy most of the time. Getting through to any number is the biggest ordeal. And even after you get through to someone, the person seems to be totally incompetent to address your concern. They say they will do something & nothing is done & then once you keep your ph down you can never get through to that same person again.

Sometimes I wonder why they even have a customer care cell? Total waste of resource and not to mention the customers time. I had thought that IRCTC had improved but guess I was hugely mistaken. Its only when one faces a problem that one realizes the true state of affairs.

Wonder if the authorities even care about the inconveniences that a common man faces because of their inefficient services"
3,"The Indian railways recently introduced 139 service. By dialing this number from your local land line or mobile phone, you can know about seat availability, PNR status and arrival and departure timing of trains. This is a very very useful facility provided to the rail travelers.

By dialing 139, you will be guided by computerized instructions. The good thing is that you can choose your own language. If you find it difficult you can choose to talk to the operator by pressing a button. But, are you satisfied with the service??

Pl look at the incidents that happened with me.

1) I was to travel in a train. The scheduled departure of the train was 1805 hrs. I was ready. I was looking for arrival status of the train in internet. There was 'no delay' in arrival of the train as mentioned in internet in the page http://www.trainenquiry.com/. However, there was no mention of time of updating of the mentioned status. So it was not reliable.

Hence, I tried 139, I was told through computerized data system that the train was running in time. At 1600 Hrs, again I used 139 service to talk to the operator who told the train was in time. So, we packed and reached at the station before enough time only to see that the train was canceled. The train was canceled from the originating station where the departure time is 1000 Hrs. I could manage to reach my destination through some other train on the next day.

2) On return, from the destination, I was to travel in a morning train which leave the station at 725 hrs. Since the train usually remains late, I preferred to know the time of arrival. from 139 service, I got the information that the train was 1.07 min late. I tried 139, ow the train was 1.18 min late. Again I tried at 800 Hrs to be informed that the train would leave reach at 832 Hrs and leave at 847 Hrs. I reached the station at 825 Hrs. When I went to inquiry counter, there was no mention of the train. I asked at the counter to only be told that the train had just left.

I had to cancel my ticket and shed out 50% of the ticket charge. Forget about the agony of traveling without a reservation in some other train. Hence, I would advise not to trust 139 service of the Indian railways. Its better if we ask the concerned inquiry counter at the stations.
"
1,"Twice I tried to book ticket on Indian Railway Net.....Money is debited from the account ......Tickets are not booked....It shows failed transaction...there is no body to address the problem...the railways ask you to prove that money is debited from your account.

You do not get refund for the failed transactions. And they want us to prove that the money is not refunded by the Railways by turning over them the Account Statement. Desspite of sending the Statement the money is not refunded. My money to the extent of Rs 8000/- is struck with them and there is no hope that I shall get the money sooner. If you want to lose your hard earned money book on Indian Railway net booking.

The problem is every thing looks fine and feel that you can get tickets sitting at home. But on the net of Indian Railway.....money is debited from your account without getting tickets booked...And there is no way to get back your money from the Railways for the failed transactions.
"
3,"Hi All

In case you are looking to check the PNR Status, Train Status and Ticket Availability in any train using SMS service, this might be helpful:

>> Checking your PNR status

sms PNR to 5676747

eg. PNR 1234567891

You can also check your PNR status by simply sending the PNR number to 5676747

e.g 12345678

>> Checking for Trains running between two stations   sms TL to 5676747

eg. TL Delhi Mumbai

You can also check trains list by sending the station name or station code.

sms TL to 5676747

e.g. TL NDLS BCT

Name of the city must be a single word without spaces:

e.g Ambala Cantt should be written as AmbalaCantt

>> Checking for Ticket Availablity   sms TA to 5676747

eg. TA 2432 delhi mumbai 17Aug

Alternatively you can call to ‘139' from your BSNL landlines, MTNL landlines, Dolphin, Garuda, Idea, Spice and Vodaphone telecom operators."
2,"Hi All, While a lot is being said on the strides of improvement and profitability the Indian Railways has done, there is one grey area which needs to be closed looked into. During the ticketing proceedure, the railways entertaing booking for passengers even after after all confirmed seats are booked. These are the RAC(reservation against cancellation) and the Waitlisted passengers. On close scrutiny I found that the railways makes a lot more money only on the cancellation charges and these cancellations, hold you breath, are being done by the railways and not by passengers! Here is how.

1) Railways make money by charging cancellation charges for confirmed passengers. Remember, those confirmed seats are at most times filled by the RAC and waitlisted passengers. What is the need for cancellation charges, when you know the seats will be occupied? Even Residential apartment builders return 100% of you apartment booking charges, if the apartment is taken by somebody else(mine did). Only in places where you find it tough to get another customer, do you leavy cancellation charges.

2) This is a big one.Railways also makes money on cancellation charges for people not confirmed on RAC and Waitlisted. As per railways policy, RAC and waitlisted passengers cannot board the train. Hence, they have no option but use other modes of communication. So not only are you inconvenienced, you also need to pay the cancellation charges( Rs 20 per person)! Little wonder the railways makes crores through such methods!"
4,"Hi everyone.

This is truely different review from my side. no analysis or attempts theroef from my side in this one. Just a tabulation of my experiences - positive as well as negatives at various points in time over the years.

SCENE No 1

Place: Bhopal

Train: Kamayani Express

From: Bhopal

To: Varanasi

Class: 2nd AC

Date: 23rd July 2000

I was waiting at the railway station at Bhopal to catch Kamayani Express since 9:30 pm at night{train time: 02:25}, as I had come from Indore to catch this train. Unfortunately, a bridge was broken between bhopal and itarsi, and the train was diverted from Itarsi.

Negative: No information was forthcoming regarding this, although this was known hours before-hand. I could have easily gone to Itarsi to catch the train. I came to know of this only at 1:00 am, when I myself inquired at the counter!

Positive: I went to the Dy SS Commercial, who assured me passage to Varanasi. The next train for Varanasi was from Itarsi{Pawan Express at 4:15 AM}. The Dy SS himself came to a train{Kerala Express, I think} and got me a seat till Itarsi. The conductor only asked me one question: Kamayani Passenger?.

At Itarsi, they had prior information of my arrival. I was received at the station and accompanied to Pawan Express, where the same experience was repeated: only one question asked: Kamayani Passenger? I was seen all the way to Varanasi as only befits a king

In both the above cases, better information management and sharing could have avoided the above scenario at least as far as customer discomfort is concerned. As far as lateness is concerned, that is a chronic case.

But the help in times of distress needs to be appreciated.

SCENE No 4

Place: Any train, Any place, Any time, Any Class

Scenario: you are hungry. you will get something to eat. I have found good, branded biscuits at Byohari{Singroli line} at 11:00 pm at night! What more can you ask for?

Yes, improvements are needed - a lot of improvement in a lot of areas. but things are much better than they were when we used to travel with Mom-Dad, and eatables were hard to come by!

The Railways are servicing one of the largest networks in world, and are doing a pretty fair job of it. What has happened is that our expectations have exploded over the past few years, and have out-stripped the rate of growth in the Railways' quality parameters. Yes, there is tremendous scope for improvement especially in the area of technology upgradation. that is the critical area. But, they will require tremendous inputs in men and material, which is going to be hard to come by.

Just consider that the Railways in also shipping freight over long distances, and is the backbone of the nation in that area too, and you will get the enormity of the problem that is confronting them. Let us all appreciate them for a fantastic job, especially considering that they are unable to charge equitable rates, and need to cross-subsidize from freight transport!

The trains and platforms are generally very clean. it is we passengers who dirty them - remember those people who throw peanut shells on the train floors? Or those who spit paan in basins and toilets? Or those who throw water on the floor and out the windows? Or those who pilfer sheets? Or those who tear up seats? Or those who damage electrical points? Or those who needlessly pull chains? Or those who write on walls? Or those who spit on platforms? Or those who urinate on platforms? Or those who throw tea cups on platforms? Or those who bribe TCs? Or those who dont buy platform tickets? Or those who travel ticketless? Or those who trouble fellow passengers? Or those who pilfer spoons? Or those who dont pay the catering staff and walk off? Are these not examples of wastage?  Pehla pathar wo maare jisne paap naa kiyaa ho, jo paapi na ho! All of us are responsible for some of these.

Yes, they need to improve. but first, let us improve ourselves in the above parameters. Are we as a people always on time? Do we never give bribes? Do we always follow the tips of cleanliness? Do we always spit in a spittoon? Are we really punctual? My 9.5 years proffessional experience has told me otherwise. I, myself am only now making a concerted effort to be punctual! I too give bribes. Let me first stop the above 2 points, then I shall start blaming the railways.

They are, after all, Indians, just like us

Just like you and me.
"
1,"I'd like to brief you about my experience with the Railways. I finished my Higher Education in

Chandigarh and had to return to Bangalore with loads of books. My friends suggested me to use the parcel Service provided by

the Railways of India instead of carrying the 26 kilos of books and documents provided by my Institute where I studied.

Agreeing to them as it seemed to be a wiser decision, I went ahead and registered with the Railways of India. The charge

levied upon the parcel was Rs 5 per kilo. This was done on the 16th of June 2007.  The parcel was supposed to reach Bangalore

in 1 week or 2 weeks max.

Having done this, I left Chandigarh and reached Bangalore. Repeatedly I asked the station parcel guys reg.

the parcel's availability. But they kept informing no parcel has come with my Reg # (D187900). Then I went to different

Parcel Offices in Bangalore Central station and enquired about the parcel. Everywhere I found only negative answers. This

went on for 3 months !! Enraged with this I registered a complains with the Claims Office. They repeatedly contacted the

Stations and asked for my parcel's availability.  The information they got was that the parcel had reached Delhi's Hyder

Nizamuddin station but its whereabouts were unknown after that!!!

The Claims Office told me that the case had to be settled i.e the compensation for the goods lost would be

available. Happy that we can produce the bills and the corresponding compensation would be available ( as promised by the

Railways), I carried along all the bills for compensation. On reaching there they asked me to attach the bills and write a

covering letter requesting for compensation. Upon reaching the other room where the Chief Officer was seated, I was informed

that I shall be Informd an amount of Rs. 1200 !!! I asked what's this compared to all that I had packed and the bills I

produced !! The reply I got was that the Government rule was to refund an amount of Rs.50/kilo and  for 24 kilos I'd get only

that much and also that the bills were for ""processing this case and if no bills were brought, even this amount would be

unavalable"". I was made to collect that amount and leave like a fool.

Friends, we come across so many services offered by private companies which levy hidden charges and cheat us.

But if the Government fools us like this what is the situation of the Indian Citizen ????????"
3,"I happened to read a news article in Mint Newspaper which was lying on the floor inside Bangalore airport last night. While I have several other posts lined up I felt this news deserves some attention.

Indian Railways has decided to increase the capacity of its train by around 12% by introducing an additional berth in the coaches. It is difficult to describe in words how they are planning to implement the same. Refer the image below for current seating layout and new layout.(S=Seat, B= Berth)

In other words, a third berth will be introduced in between existing 2 berths on the side seats. This extra passenger will be sharing seats with either of the three passengers as shown in the diagram.

Reportedly this idea of increasing the capacity has been accepted to generate more revenue by carrying more passengers in same number of trains, so that the need to increase ticket fare will be eliminated.
"
2,"In the last two years there was a huge image re construction of Indian Railways. There has been a major image overhaul of the services and online boom is a major reason for that.

By on line boom I mean

~~ The ease of getting reservations (normal & tatkal) through internet.

~~ An option to check the running status of Trains

~~ Automated replies through phone. There are Numbers like 311, 312 where you can check your PNR No., whether a train has left the specified station or not etc.

With all these features and many more the government has been boasting of the growth of Indian Railways. But are these changes for real? Do they really help the passengers? Or It was just pre election hype created by Lalu Prasad Yadav?

I’ll share my experience with you all.

With Diwali vacations round the corner we got our reservations done the day it opened. But a confusion here & confusion there we had the confirmed tickets of one day before the vacations started. SO we ended up with a waiting ticket.

But since we were relying on our Broadband connection (we are planning to say Tata to them as Reliance on any of these connections is like building castles in Air) we thought we will get the reservations through IRCTC & under Tatkal.

The D Day came we were logged in before 8 AM and could see the seats available. At Dot 8 the system went off.

For Next 1 Hour the site didn’t connect. The message which came was Communication Failure, Train doesn’t exist, Couldn’t Log onand what not.

~~ The underlying fact is, Facility is there but can we rely on it fully? How come the sites are down at the nth hour only? Is there any foul play?

~~ We were looking out our reservation to Varanasi. The status showed only 125 seats available. When we boarded the train it is was more than half empty. Foul play again? Can we really rely on status reflected on the site?

~~ On our return trip our reservation was Waiting 1 & 2. Before the trains started Waiting 1 was confirmed & 2nd remained Waiting 2 till the end. When we reached the station & checked the Chart Waiting 3 was confirmed and so were no 13 & 23. How come No. 2 was skipped? Against No 3 there was a mention HO. When we asked the TT what does it mean? He said it might be some quota. Hello!!! TT’s are supposed to know the real meanings of the abbreviations, right? Foul Play again.? 

~~To check the current running status we kept on calling the specified numbers but they were continuously engaged. Reason? Phone kept on hold. One more facility wasted.

~~ Being the way I am I was checking the running status of train through the website http://www.trainenquiry.com. Same old story there, at 10 PM the last updated was of 14:00 Hrs. One more facility useless.

~~ At the station there was display of the current status of the trains. Our train was supposed to arrive at 00:30 Hrs. The display didn’t change till 00:55 when suddenly there was an announcement that trains No 2154 is arriving on Platform No. 1 in Kucch hi pal. Whom can we rely on?

Those were basically the technical aspects; let’s look into the other aspects.

$$Being the cautious person I am I had cooked the food and locked it in my bag. We boarded the train and suddenly my 6th sense said, Smita you have left the keys at home. I raked in my pitara (purse) and my 6th sense was right. So we ordered vegetable biryani worth of 40 Rs and one lunch costing Rs 35.

Biryani was plain rice thrown with vegetables. No spice, no salt & No spoon.Repeated request but we ended up eating with our hands.

Lunch? We had better food in hostel.

To add to my woes, not even one coffee vendor on the way. The train was from Mumbai to Muzzafarpur (Bihar) and it didn't have a pantry car.

$$ No body follows the weight limit restriction. And No body is questioned also.

$$ Toilets get dirty on a long route train, water finsihes but there is not soultion to them.

All in all the overall experience was disappointing. But being the optimistic person I am I have learned something for my next trip.

We all know that we can not expect things to improve drastically. So we have to take things in our hands. Here are the solutions according to me

^^ Before getting your reservations done break a coconut in front of the entire God’s.

^^ Keep a back up plan of a reliable reservation agent ready in all cases.

^^ Always keep food outside the locks.

^^ Keep several books with you lest you have to wait at the station as you don’t get reliable information about the current status of your train. (Now you all now how I have finished 4 books in my vacations)

^^ Before next vacations instead of clothes or jewelries invest in Air Ticket.

^^ Don’t believe in whatever is being said by Indian Railways. Things surely have improved but there is a long way to go.

On a serious note my experience has told me that whatever the ho hallah was there  for the revamped image of Indian Railways. Its some part truth & mostly marketing gimmicks for votes.

Majority of Indians are still dependent on this mode of travel & that is the reason that the passengers are taken for granted.

Introducing newer technology is necessary but implementation is the key and that’s where we all lack.

I have used IRCTC a lot and it seriously saves loads of time, but why doesn't it work for Tatkal?

Despite the sorry state of affairs and average rating I have still recommended the product. Why?

We still don't have a better and cheaper alternative for an average Indian.

PS Request you all to share your experience in the comments. Sometimes they help.

3,"Railways, as once said, r the backbone of a nation. Myself being a working woman & living in city like Mumbai - having to commute to far off distances for work, couldn’t agree more on this.

But come corruption & the complete spirit of it st& lost. I don’t disagree with the growth & the improvements visible in the Indian Railways in the past couple of years & couldn’t help appreciating the facilities being introduced & changes being made in order to provide for comfortable journey for the commuters.

All said & done, while riding high on the wings of progress we sometimes wish to forget that while change is supposed to be the only constant thing, corruption instead is the one thing that is constant in India – a parasite that is multiplying exponentially.

I would share my recent experiences on one of the trains with Indian Railways & would leave it onto the readers to analyze & justify the current situation in the government sector in India & how we as responsible & educated citizens can help in curbing the same.

I along with my family recently happened to travel from New Delhi to Jammu & return, the mode of transportation being Northern Railways. The trains & the respective conditions as experienced, that I am about to describe, r for the following trains:

Uttar S Kranti  - Train No. 2445 - Up

Shalimar Express - Train No. 4645 - Up

Shalimar Express - Train No. 4646 - Down

We were booked on AC 3 tier coach, needless to say that people spare that extra money & book themselves on an AC coach for some basic expectations that includes

Clean coaches

Clean toilets with water availability

Clean & sufficient bedding

Least of all temperature control(at least that’s what the word AC is supposed to mean)

Since the journey is an overnight 12 hour+ journey, these things become the basic necessity & I pity to admit that none, mind me NONE of these facilities were being available in any of these trains throughout.

I would account for these one by one.

As for the clean coaches, since entering the coach we saw a herd of cockroaches marching fearlessly in the coach, climbing the seats & inspecting each commuter & their luggage. The cockroaches never seemed to stop, they kept on coming from nowhere all through the journey to an extend that people had to cover their faces while sleeping to avoid health hazards. I wonder if this was the state of an AC coach what would people in general compartment be going through!

As for temperature control, there was none. We kept waiting for some time initially, but all in vain. It was not until about an hour passed since the train had started, & the heat & suffocation became unbearable, that we finally asked the attendant for AC & lo! here the AC’s started working as if they were just waiting for someone to complain – lets save as much as we can by not switching AC’s on until any of the commuters complain – let them suffer till they can! This was the attitude of the attendant.

Not to mention about the cleanliness of the toilets. I can only sum up saying there was nothing that can be called clean. To top it all there was no water availability & the attendant just kept giving excuses saying that once the train attains speed the water would be available - what crap! The only reason I could see was that the cleaners were all busy selling paper soaps & candies in the coaches. I am not sure if they r even allowed to do so. The frustration of the commuters reached the brim when one of them shouted, “Where & how do u expect us to use these paper soap strips that u r selling every 5 minutes?”

Now comes the best part – when the workers started distributing the bedding for the night, we noticed that there was one sheet missing per person. Though there r supposed to be 2 sheets provided to each commuter, these people were doing away with just 1. On asking they simply said that on this train it’s a norm to give only 1 sheet. We resorted to challenge the same & approached the TT who agreed that these people r playing fowl & they should provide two sheets per person. After a long follow up of about an hour we got remaining one sheet per person for our family. Still the staff didn’t bother to give away the 2nd sheet to any of the other passengers for the simple reason that they did not bother to complain.

The similar thing happened in case of hand towels, No hand towels were issued to travelers & on querying we got the same-recorded response – “We do not have h& towels on this train”. On complaining for this too, suddenly the towels appeared from nowhere, this time again only for our family because we had complaint.

Something very similar happened when we ordered for dinner on these trains. Food is not included in the ticket price on these trains & we need to order & pay for it separately. Very few people know that when u order for food on Indian Railway, a packaged glass of dinking water & a packaged bowl of curd r mandatory to be a part thereof, which obviously were missing from our plates. Forget about the curd, when we asked for water, again the same reply came – “We do not serve water with food on this train”. Now almost accustomed to this answer of theirs, when we told them not to teach us rules, they agreed that it is supposed to be but they forgot to load water today. On further arguments, the staffer selling food, bought from is own pocket, & gave us two 1 liter packaged drinking water bottles. Now anybody can make out why would an employee spend from his own pocket, until he has some guilt to shield… This again, was not provided to other commuters since they never bothered to ask for their rights.

Now just come to think of it, there r hundreds of commuters traveling on these trains at one time & this I am talking of 3 trains that I know of, might be similar situation on hundreds of trains. Just imagine how much money these people r  making for themselves on the governments’ & our expenses. We pay & government provide these things for our usage then who r these people to deny us of our rights & make money for themselves?

They save crates of food supplements supposed to be served to travelers & sell them in the open market to make money. They save on the efforts of distributing, collecting & counting linen & steal on the money saved from laundry of these. I’m sure they must be showing the allowable 5% loss of linen even though they distribute only 40% of the actual linen & sell off the remaining in market to keep their pockets warm.

I would say that it is we who promote & inspire these people to start practices like these; it is we who r to be blamed for their flourishing businesses. Had we bothered & cared to know & raised for our rights, would anybody be able to take advantage like this? Never!

Wake up People – its time we know & practice our rights & help our bit in making the progress measures a success for the nation.

1,"Chennai MRTS was launched  with much fanfare in 1998 between Chennai Beach station and Mylapore(lovingly called MYLAI) .We all thought what an innovative way of moving across Chennai.-I too was taken on a free ride along with my parents and children(the ride was free on day 1)

Nine years has passed since .The project is still to be completetd!.The  Genaral Manager, Southern railway announced in January, 2007 that MRTS will run  upto Velachery by March 2007 .I went personally with the family to see  if the work was completed (in Feb, 2007).The track s were not even laid fully .

How can authorities continue to take people for a long ride?.Do they ever get out of their air conditioned offices and go to the field?(ofcourse they do if there is a minister's visit to pose for photographs or if their agency ends up managing an accident, killing people).Shameless officials.

Finally the citizens are also shameless as we continue to take what ever they are offering and end up paying more taxes for useless poor quality services.I encourage you to come and visit some of the MRTS stations and personally undertand what poor quality means.(Stations to visit Light house , Mylapore and Tiruvaamnmyur , visit look around, smell and better be careful  not to fall off !)

Even after reading this if you dont get angry and upset then you desreve to travel in the filthy Suburban rail system and the  poor quality of services from  railways.

4,"Indian Railways is Doing tremendous improvement

The Railways has been doing a  tremendous improvement under the able leadership of Shri Laloo Prasad Yadav.

Its really a boon to have online reservations   e-tickets , i-tickets etc., No more standing in queues, paying the touts for a ticket.

But Here I would like to include certain areas in which attention is required.

The First and fore most I would like to talk about is Platform Ticket Vending.

I recently had a close family member visiting Delhi and he was to come in the Hazrat Nizammudin Station. I had arrived well in advance knowing that there will be some or other issue and was taken back to see the Queue in ticket counters. I required a platform ticket and the queue in the counter was really scary but I dared to stand. After standing there for 30mins I thought it would be ridiculous if were to succeed getting the ticket but miss the passenger as the train was due to arrive. I rushed to the platform and was just in time to receive the person. I was on my way back and just as we climbed the steps of the platform I was shocked to see a Checking inspector who was inspecting all the passengers. I anyhow managed to give a slip but. the point here it is really hard to get a platform ticket in stations and this is not only in one station but most of the main stations.

Solution:

One solution could be to install automatic platform ticket vending machines(Even the ones which are used as weighing machines can be used) You pop in the correct change and it gets you back a platform ticket with your weight printed on the back .

*Clean Platforms

*The Condition of the platforms are worse . Stations in places like

Agra

Haridwar

etc.,

Which have religious, tourism related interests should be made world class.

Solution:

Take cue from international Stations like in London/Newyork they are really good.

. Will be continued"
2,"We all know that railways are a monopoly sector in our country. I am not sure whether the suggestion/complaint posted on mouthshut will reach to the concerned authorities or not. But it will atleast be an eye opener for all those who have not yet experinced all this.

Due to flood situation in Gujarat, trains coming from Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Mumbai are running late for last 3-4 days. All media channels are showing this news.

I  tried to find the status on 131 or 132  but was never able to get  the correct information about the number of hours of delay in arrival / departure. To my great surprise at some point of time during the day(on 4th July) on dialing train number 2479 - it was announced ’no information available’

Further more if you select the menu in HINDI, you will not be able to get the message properly. One has to try this to know the reality.

On the website http://www.traininquiry.com most of the times in last 5 days, it was showing the train 2479 or 2480 ’no delay’ in arrival / departure from Bandra Terminus. Even the display system at new built building of this station, do not work.

Several passengers had to stay at platforms, just waiting for trains / correct announcements.
"
1,"I am regular user of Internet and may be the early birds who opted for POP account from VSNL those days standing in the line at VSNL office Churchgate. So basically I know what how and when of Internet and its uses. FEw days back I tried to book Tatkal ticket for my family members and after some time able to get ticket in 3 A/c for two. As per my past practice I checked my Credit card Web site to see how much they have charged me.I was shocked to see that they have charged me four time. Then I got four ticket confirmation also from them. So in one ticket booking I got four ticket, I was bit shocked but then knew these computer mistake happens sometimes due to so many factors. I contacted IRCTC and was shocked to hear that you have doen booking four time in one minute [I must be biggest hacker of Indian IT firm] and being rules of the Railway you have to cancel the tickets and you will be given 25% of value of tkts due to Tatkal tickets.I also wrote to my credit card company to stop payment and register my compliant. So the things are in bit doll drums and I am fighting with both parties to rectify the problem and refund my money.

As per any purchase of railway ticket it should ask you the details of passengers+ other details then it should go to payment gate way they should ask all details and payment to be made. in this case only once they have asked me the details and given four ticket even with all these procedures.

My intention is to inform your member through your site to be care full while registering with IRCTC site. Even after accepting if they donot give confirmation of tkt, do not think that it is not booked they must have booked it and if you again try it new tkt will be issued.

Also even be care full in pressing the buy button if you press two time you wil get two tkts. it totally absurd but it is true.

I am fighting my case but with this review members of this site will be bit educated.

with best regards,

3,"I trust that this space is regularly accessed by the PRO of the Indian Railways. I wish to bring to their notice this disturbing  development , increased during recent times. I also wish to warn the would be travellers to take adequate precautions.

The most widely abused date rape drugs in the world are

ativan(lorazepam)

nitravet(nitrazepam). These are odourless, tasteless and can be added to any drink, tea, coffee, coke, soft drinks, lassi etc. In U.S.A. flunitrazepam is used more often and now chloral hydrate (difficult to detect in urine). However, due to ease of availablity, Indians use only the 2 drugs listed above. A person loses sensorium within 15 minutes to 30 mins and has no recollection of the events of the next 6 to 12 hours, depending on the dosage.

In the past 1 month, 6 of my patients have been administered these drugs at the New Delhi, Old Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin railway stations. They have been befriended by some one at the station, and offered a drink, cold drink mostly. After 15 minutes, they have lost consciousness and then been looted of all their cash, watch, mobile, baggage. The lucky ones have  awoken at the same spot after 12 hours but those who have been unlucky to start walking after a varied period of time, have been thought to drunk and either bashed up or taken to the police station.

However the honourable Railway minister may notice that very few police stations register their F.IR. as they feel it is the jurisdiction of the R.P.F.

Classically, the persons looted are migrant workers , going home after 6 to 9 months of working in the factories/export houses and going home with atleast 15 grand in cash . Mostly travellers to Jharkhand and Bihar are targetted.

Once they regained senses, they ring up their friends who brought them to me in varied states of dehydration. Gurgaon police say this has not happened in their jurisdiction.

*HISTORICAL FACTS

*The last time I was witness to large scale poisoning and looting was in 1989 to 1991 when posted at military hospital Ambala Cantt.  At the time a large contingent of IPKF was posted in Sri Lanka. The jawans used to be given leave every 3 to 6 months. They used to be airlifted from Chennai to Delhi or Chandigarh , from where they used to catch trains to their destinations. Ambala being a large railway junction, they used to cross it in large numbers. They used to carry cash, VCRs, cameras, canteen items.Cash was a lot since they got leave advance and also some foreign allowance.

We got more than 40 soldiers in varying states of sensorium. The drugs were identified as ativan and nitravet . When combine with alcohol , their effects lasted upto 3 days as dosages given were very huge.

HOW THE PROBLEM WAS TACKLED

The only way we could tackle was through education. Military police and civil police could not keep vigil at all places. So we made frequent announcements on the public address sysems on stations and on radio programmes for faujis. At the unit level also soldiers were briefed by their commanders before proceeding on leave. Finally they were forced to carry bank drafts and not cash. It was 6 months before we got results.

WHAT CAN BE DONE

Now that you have more effective communication methods on stations, like televisions and better audio systems a sustained broadcasting effort must be taken by the railways to warn the public. other media can also be made use of.

Basically the message must be not to accept food/drinks from unknown persons, regardless of how well bred and trustworthy they may appear.

film footage of a few looted passengers can also be shown.

Cases must be registered and followed up with  methodically. Exemplary and swift punishment must be meted out to the offenders.

5,"Was Indian Railways a Loss making organization? By Pritis Chandra Majumdar Now and then, particularly when Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav took over the Indian Railways charge as Railway Minister, some regional and national news paper started to propagate the incorrect message about Indian Railways buttering the minister concerned. Such latest news they published (Bengali and English news paper) is: Indian Railways were running on loss so far and Mr. Laloo made it profit maker with thousands of crores surplus. It is not understood where from this type of unauthentic information the news paper reporters got and what is the authorized source of generation of such desperate incorrect information.

Let us look back and just go through the statistical statements and financial accounts since 1950 to 1997 – 98. There was no year in the past since 1950 as the loosing year except in 1970 – 71 and 1980 – 81 when the losses were19.84 crores and 197.87 crores respectively and the operating ratio in 1970 – 71 and 1980 – 81 were 84.13% and 96.07% respectively. In the last four years from 1994 – 95, 1995 -96, 1996 – 97 and 1997 – 98 the excess were Rs 2, 445.40 crores, Rs. 2, 870.63 crores, Rs.2, 117.06 crores and Rs. 1, 535.22 crores respectively.

These figures are available in the Annual Reports and Accounts of Indian Railways. It was also seen in the same report that in 1950 – 51 and 1960 – 61 the excess were Rs. 15.05 crores and Rs. 32.01 crores when operating ratio was 81.00% and 78.75% respectively.

I personally was involved directly with the railways for about 40 years and as such I got opportunity to share all ups and downs of the railways since 1964. But fortunately, I never saw minister like Mr. Laloo who increased expenditure desperately breaking all rules and policies of the railways like violation of reduction of manpower @ 3% per year, introducing free pass for traveling in trains to PORTERS who are not railway employees and take over-charges than that of actual rate of railways from every passengers taking their assistance for carrying luggage.

Besides, additional recurring expenditure was forced upon the railways after creation of new seven railway zones for new infrastructure and additional posts of man power from General Manager to downwards, creating additional recruitment of Railway Protection Forces etc.

Over and above these huge additional expenditure, he did not raise passengers’ fare during his tenure of office. I travelled in trains and found that nothing passengers’ amenities and facilities were offered after his claim of huge surplus in revenues rather he introduced unhygienic earthen pot for tea and passengers drastically rejected those earthen pot. These earthen cups cost also more than conventional synthetic tea-cup and glass. From the above we can realize that Indian Railways were never running on loss except those two years mentioned above.

Then why reporters are buttering Mr. Laloo publishing incorrect information? This is a question of billion dollars These reporters never referred any authentic reference of railways except Ministers’ verbal press reporting –cum-advertisement with photo session posing as managent guru. What I feel is that actual financial health of Indian Railways will be unearthed after Laloo’s departure from Rail-Mnistership, if not another scam of fodder and other court cases during his Chief Ministership may engulf him. Thus the myth of loss making railway should happily be ignored as the reason might be the his political rival ex-rail minister."
4,"I would like to record my appreciation to the sincere TTE of Jana Shatabdi train (Hubli to B'lore) travelling on 28th Jan'07 in AC chair car coach -C1. The TTE showed his sincerity to his work and real guts in showing the exit to a high profile arrogant person accompained by 2 cops and usual followers.

The high profile person was travelling in a pre-dated ticket, got into a wrong compartment and demanded the seats of a valid ticket holder sitting in his assigned seat in a not so elegant behaviour expected out of such a high profile personaility. A clear indication of disregard and disrespectful behaviour towards the common people.

I was really surprised at the TTE who allocated the vacant seats to the valid waitlisted ticket holders and did not budge to these high profile misusers of power, incidentally can be called as ticketless traveller as they were holding a pre-dated and useless ticket. My sincere appreciation to this TTE. We need people like this and I am sure Indian Railways  will achieve far higher profits by hardwork of these simple people."
2,"I know and have heard of all the hoopla created over the reduction of costs in the luxury trains of the likes of Rajdhani and other AC coaches of superfast trains. We were all happy at the way the rail ministry responded when the air fare fell low enough for the middle class to climb on the roof of the railways and reach out for that plane travel easily. The rail ministry just made the fares for the railway travel fall so that the common man does not think of going towards that air travel and feels happier about using the railways as his sole means of travel. But what they didnt realise is that the quality of service would fall by leaps and bounds.

I know, it sounds a bit cruel on the part of the really comon man who were not able to pay for the luxury travel by railways, and now are actually able to avail of that. But what about the people who were able to pay that little extra and wanted to get that better service which once existed.

I will explain exactly what I mean by the better service. I remember previously in Rajdhani every passenger was enquired of, everything from a broader need like if they needed anything else to the smallest of need like if they could bring some more of that ice cream to cater to that taste bud of yours which might not be quite satisfied by the amount offered. If you are getting me you would understand that I am not talking of the materialistic things . I am talking about their attitude. The fact that they were previously ready to go that extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. That is what goes missing now .

Yes they charge less, but you will get to see things like Unuchs troubling passengers for money in the normal class from which the ticket checker and the railway security get a share. That is a scene which people have been complaining about for a while now. But what really shook me hard was the introduction of vendors from the station onto the first class coach of Poorva express. Now that was something that was never allowed. Never in the right knowledge could the local vendors from the station board the first class. Then I witnessed an episode of the local vendor arguing with the express officials about the share they have to pay. When I complained to the ticket checker, his responce was very vague as if he just came to know about it and didnt hve any idea as to what action to take. He said that he would be looking into it and disappeared.

Only the official express vendors should be allowed not any vendor . and if they are boarding the train, then where is the security, one of the things I am paying extra for, other than the comfort.

Now you tell me some good reasons as to why I should not reach out for that air travel which saves upto 5 folds the time and is much more comfortable charging about as much as those railways with a bogus service and no sence of customer satisfaction. If they hink they are saving the railways, I would say they are all the more killing it.

The only solution I can think of to prevent the dissatisfied customers to look the air travel way is to have 2 versions of luxury travel like in planes. One where people who are willing to pay can get the right service they are looking for and one the luxury coach meant for the masses where they can continue with their level of service and no one would mind as they would be happy enough to avail of the service."
3,"Hi everybody,

I want to share my view about indian railways.Today railways is the heart of indians but it is our helplessness to travell in railways because we have no good option.

if u want to think about to go anywhere u have to plan at least 15 days before shedule.u have to spend more & more time for issuing a ticket.reservation  line is so long .line is not moving because ticket clerk is also booking some ticket from agent that r not in line & if they be in line then they have many requistion form .it is noted in form that one form will accepted from one person but clerk don't denied to accept form because he gets some commision on this form therefore line remain in same postion & passenger have to wait upto long hour .normaly passenger have to wait upto 1-2 hour.today every person is very busy & why we waste so much time on this.

except it railways website is also too slow  if your internet connection is very good yet u required at least 15-30 minutes for booking a ticket on net.& normally ticket is not booked properly & amount is deducted from your account & refund is possible after 3 days.tatkal service is also too bad.

why we prefer travel by train the main purpose is to save time but most of train become late.
"
2,"Most of the issues related to Indian Railways have been taken up, quite ably by the other reviewers. I am writing a small reveiw about my experience with the Internet booking system of the Indian Railways.

A month back, I wanted to book a railway ticket from Nagpur to Delhi, and therefore I decided to try out the Internet booking system. After having registered at the site, I filled in the required information and pressed the submit button, which to my surprise resulted in ""nothing"" at all. Thinking that this is a problem of my internet connection, I emptied the cache, rebooted, checked the net connection on a couple of other sites, and tried again, with the same results. The next day, I tried booking through an internet cafe - and - again nothing. I then had to book the ticket at the railway station itself.

Having checked with a number of people, I now know that the railway internet reservation system is quite erratic, and doesn't work a number of times. I do realize that an internet transaction site has problems from time to time, but the railways booking system is problamatic much more often. If they are thiking of offering excuses like the ""large number of visits and transactions"" etc., Amazon and ebay have even higher traffics, and they are not even ""the world's largest employer"".

Additionally the railway reservation site is not operation in the evenings, and night time (IST). There is no reason why it should not be on. Or is the internet too, part of the railway employee's union. Actually the railway employees are even working in the night time, the internet seems to be a union member with special off-time rights. :-)

I do understand the need of the Indian Railways to gather financial resources, but pasting the website with cheap looking, flashy, bandwidth hogging, and plain annoying advertisements is certainly not the way. They can take a leaf out of Google's book and go for a few targetted text based advertisements, or they can put just one plain advertsiement, and charge for the exclusiveness.

I do hope that Indian Railways makes the internet booking round the clock, and enhances the backoffice software to get rid of continuous problems. Only then will the Internet booking system function as a true boon, and not an only too occasional bane. I am giving it an average rating, and poor quality. Maybe the quality of service is better than many other government (or even private) services in India, but in comparision to even the most basic transaction websites, it is quite poor.

Note:

Actually the ""Staff Courtesy"" section does not apply, but as it is mandetory, I am giving it the same points as the ""Quality of service"" section, taking the annoying ads in consideration. :-)
"
3,"I read the comment posted by Mr.Santulan regarding the services offered by Rajdhani Express. I totally agree with him and there is one more issue that I would like to bring to your attention.

Indian railway is the largest network in the world now but till now we do not have standard services even in the countries best trains: Rajdhani Express. I am talking about the linens that are distributed to the passengers during their journey. Unfortunately, these are not maintained properly .Even when we asked them to change the linens it was of no use, since all of them were in the similar deplorable conditions with oil stains and dirt on the same, it appeared as if it was not washed after one or two usage, which is really unhygienic.

When the passengers are paying for the extra services then small issues like meal, drinking water and laundry should be treated with equal importance.

Rajdhani, which was once known for its effective services, is degrading its standards day by day. Hopefully it will improve it service in future."
2,"Hi,

Indian railway line is the world's largest railway line. The railway routes cover a total length of 63,940 km (39,230 miles). As of 2005 IR owns a total of 216,717 wagons, 39,936 coaches and 7,339 locomotives and runs a total of 14,244 trains daily, including about 8,002 passenger trains. Now, railway is the main source for travelling in India. It divided in Eastern, Western, Northern, southern and central railway. Indian railway connects all the major cities of the India and nearly covers the small towns of India. Although when we talk about the services of Indian railway, it is one of the low quality service provider in every aspects.

Indian population crossed billion marks so the big load also on railway.

Reservation counters never free from morning 8 O'clock to evening 8 O'clock. A long queue always waits for tickets infront of booking windows. Booking windows are not sufficient for any class of tickets at the stations. Travel agents and brokers take benefits of these irregularities. Nowadays people don’t have so time to spend on booking window. So they pay some extra money to the brokers and get ticket. Now this leads to unauthorized ticket booking by the brokers.

Many railway employees are involved with the brokers in unauthorized bookings. Brokers take out tickets by the any name and sell it in double price in peak time. They book the tickets before the 30-45 days. There is no regulation on brokers by the railway.

If I leave some trains, than late coming of trains is as usual as daily routine. There is no consideration and importance of the time. Passengers have to take care and add contingencies time in their schedule.

I have seen the railways T.T.E.s are one of best example of corruption. If anybody missed train or not come, they take money for vacant seats openly from any other passenger who is in waiting list and the eligible passenger never know that his waiting list confirmed in the train.

Even one time when I was travelling from Mumbai to Delhi, T.T.E. came after 5 hours to check the ticket. That time I was in another seat with my friend for sometime and my luggage was in my seat. But T.T.E. came and cancelled my ticket and given to another passenger who had waiting ticket. He didn't listen to anyone. Train was Swaraj express (Jammu Tawi). That T.T.E. was taking money openly from many people to provide seats and valid passenger didn't get seat. I complained this irregularity in Delhi railway station. But nothing happened.

And onetime in Delhi, It was the height of Railway, the two Coach (Boggy) was not attached in the train and reservation given to the passengers. After that they attached General class Coach to travel.

Railway website is so slow. Sometimes it opens after waiting very long time.

General class people are the biggest sufferer of railway. If you find chance, see the general class Coach condition. I am horrified how the people travel long distances in such a rushful boggy.

Food is also one of worst kind in trains and costly compared to quality. Hawkers (tea sellers) within trains are very disturbing guys. They continue run from here to there and speak so loudly.

To make a journey by train, people make plans to buy ticket before 15-30 days. Finding a ticket in emergency is so tough. Now ''Tatkaal'' reservation is also occupied by the brokers. Needy people unable to find ''Tatkaal'' ticket.

In sleeper and general coaches, people sleep in gallery for long journey. Such a heavy rush in trains. Those who have to travel in emergency can't ignore it. Summers season (Holidays) are the curse for travelers because they have to book tickets before 1 month and in some trains before 45 days.

I can't say much more about Trains running in South. But the railway stations in Metros are very crowdy. Stations are not well furnished except few.

Railway fare is cheap compared to other means of travel. Local trains are the life of Mumbaikars.IR is the world's largest commercial or utility employer, with more than 1.6 million employees. These are the few good things with Railway.

4,"History of Indian Railway

History of Indian Railway began on 22 Dec 1851 when a goods train started. First passenger train started on 16 Apr 1953 between Mumbai and Thane. Thus for more than 150 years Indian Railway is serving us nicely. Since then Indian Railway had grown slowly and steadily. In 1952 Zonal system had been introduced in Railway with total Six Zones. With the development, it has reached to total 17 zones.

Current Status

In 17 zones, Indian railway is having more than 8700 passenger trains. It is covering all states except Sikkim. Indian Railway provides many suburban railway services in major cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi & Hyderabad. Railway is one of the most preferred transportation medium. A normal passenger train consists of eighteen coaches where 9 coaches are sleeper class; 3-5 are air-conditioned coaches. A normal passenger sleeper coach accommodates 60 to 72 passengers. Indian Railways makes 70% of its revenues and most of its profits from the freight sector. Indian Railways operates with 7,500 + Engines; 37,800 + passenger coaches and 222000 + wagons. There are 6,850 + stations and 700 + repair shops. Indian

Railway maintains total workforce of 15,40,000 largest employer in the world.

Railway - Lalu Prasad & Their achievements

Indian railway was running in losses since years. It had been taken as granted that this PSU can never be a profit making undertaking for Indian government. But Lalu Prasad Yadav has proven this wrong. He has presented figures where Indian Railway has made profit for year 2004-05. He has also presented 2006 budget with Rs 56,000 cr income and Rs 7000 Cr profit. Look at his amazing initiatives for Indian Railway

# e-ticketing and SMS booking of tickets

# Any holder of a wait-listed ticket can be allotted accommodation in a higher class with no extra charges.

# Tatkal tickets can be booked three days in advance and higher tatkal charges.

# Commercial use of Railway land for food, entertainment and other purpose.

# Surprise checking at railway stations for staff attendance, weights of consignments and etc.

# Name and number of Vigilance officers published in News papers for any complaints.

Believe me Lalu Prasad Yadav is a smart man and having capacity of working like a CEO of a company. It is the cast politics of Bihar which forced him to behave like a villager. This fact is acknowledged by IIM - A professor and students. They have noticed the turned around happened with Indian Railway. They visited Lalu Prasad and discussed the topic. They are going to add a case study on Indian Railway in their syllabus.

Challenge in front of Railway

I like to mention this in few lines only that’s why I am giving main points only - Crime, Accidents, Ticket less Traveling, Underweight Fares of goods, Overcrowding at one place and empty railway at other place. Let’s see how Lalu prasad yadav resolves this issues.

Trivia :

With 150 + years of history and 8700 + trains Indian Railway is full of Trivia. I collects few for you :

# Mumbai's suburban railway is the densest route in the world. It is attending 65 lakh passengers daily. The density of passengers in peak hours is 15 people per sq meter.

# The Fairy Queen is the oldest running locomotive in the world today.

# The shortest named station is Ib and the longest is Sri Venkatanarasimharajuvariapeta.

# Kharagpur railway station is the world's longest railway platform at 1072 m.

# The Himsagar Express (between Kanyakumari and Jammu Tawi) has the longest run 3745 km.

# The Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India a maximum speed of 140 km/h

# The Busiest railway Stations are as following with trains per day. Delhi + New Delhi 120, Lucknow 65, Ahmedabad 60

# Would you believe there is an official website of fans of Indian Railway : http://www.irfca.org

Indian Railway on World Map :

# Indian railway has 3 World Heritage Site - The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, The Nilgiri Mountain Railway & the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway.

# ''The Palace on Wheels'' is world famous tourism train of Rajasthan which is loved by people across the globe.

3,"I travelled via Sabari Express (train number 7230) from Hyderabad to Palghat, Kerala.

I decided to travel by 2nd AC, since it should have been more comfortable. My seat was 45 and wife's was 46. It was the compartment closest to the toilet. What a mistake that was! By the evening, cockroaches were starting to appear around our compartment and on the curtains. I went to the toilet and found the roaches on the walls, sink etc. We told the attendant about the problem, who said that he 'will look into it'. On the wall outside the toilet, there was a sign which stated 'pest control in use'. The train ride was long (about 25 hours). I couldn't sleep comfortably as one eye was kept open for any cockroach sightings! It was a sleepless night until we reached Palghat.

I booked by train again for the return journey (only because no flights were available on the day which we wanted). This time we had our seating towards the middle of the train and away from the toilet. This was a dramatic difference as there were no cockroaches to be found! Also, the toilets themselves had far fewer roaches crawling on the walls. Maybe they took action and did something about the problem. I slept comfortably on the upper bunk. Next thing I know, there is a chorus of snores all around me. (my wife said I was snoring as well) I went to the toilet and found the attendant also asleep on his bed with the sheeting covering him.

The food on the railways was not that great. We brought supper from home, but had to order breakfast. I had idli and vada. Not the type of food that mama cooks at home! There is always kowfee and chai available. Not too bad, but I found it be on the sweeter side.

Overall, the Sabari train ride is not for someone who likes things perfectly clean and insect free."
3,"It’s been a long time, eh?

It was six fifteen of the evening at the Pune railway station when I dropped my heavy suitcase and baggage on the platform. I took a good look around me and I noticed the amazing detail of observation of my class seven teacher, who had dictated that 500 words essay on railway stations. Things were there, exactly in the same place as described in that essay. The clock, the platform number-boards, the overbridges, the AH Wheeler Bookstalls, the people with large and small handbags, the speakers for announcements and, among other trivial and incidental things, railway trains.

I don’t usually travel by railways. So it was with the excitement of a second-standard student who notices stuff he’s only heard of in the classroom that I said—“Ma, wow, that’s a coolie!”

So, feeling as stupid as an ape, jumping in joy quite involuntarily when I saw such basic things on the platform, I found myself standing at the platform, with half an hour to kill before the Pune-Ahmedabad Ahimsa express was scheduled to arrive.

Meanwhile, in front of me, I could see a train. (And yeah, you guessed right- I jumped up and down on the balls of my feet and kept pestering mom till she allowed me to go and touch it. Are you satisfied?). I remembered that there is always a board on the bogies of the train on which you can read where that train is going to. But I couldn’t see that board from where I was standing (and I guess it must really have depressed me, because that was the only detail from the essay which I didn’t get to observe). Taking pity on me, my mom asked me to wait till the announcement is made.

(And so like the eternally enthusiastic little brat of seven years age) I went down to the place where I could see the speaker, so that I’ll know what train it was. In five seconds the announcement was made.

“May I have your attention please? The Garbled to Garbled, Damned Garbled Express will leave at its scheduled time of Garbled Hours and Even More Garbled Minutes from platform number Inexorably Garbled ”

(Crestfallen like a little child who realizes that his role model, the engine driver, doesn’t get to own a railway engine) I scurried back to mom, to tell her about the story of the garbled express. I was asked to check on it once more.

No point.

So I decided to screw the essay and junk the schoolish ‘observe what your textbooks have been trying to choke your nose with’ adventure, and took to a more mature and grown-up activity of observing the human life on the platform.

I faced an overload of samples.

A man with a towel wrapped around his waist and nothing else, with his perfectly spherical belly open to the public. Then this woman sitting by the window a little off, throwing banana peels on the platform and, I don’t know how it happened, eating banana chips (you have all sorts of nuts in the world, don’t you?). Then there were these two brats juggling two balls, which seemed to have a strange attraction towards the pot bellied chap (one of those balls did enter his towel… fun, eh?).

Suddenly…

“May I have your attention please? The Garbled to Garbled , Damned Garbled Express will leave at its scheduled time of Garbled Hours and Even More Garbled Minutes from platform number Inexorably Garbled .”

There was a very reluctant hiss punctuated by a comfortable horn and the Garbled-to-Garbled Garbled express in front of us started moving from Platform Number Irrevocably Garbled. (Once again, the surge of childish excitement in me, so that mommy had to hold me by the collar to prevent me from chasing the train to touch it one last time).

Amidst such utter confusion, came the realization that the train we were going to board was half an hour late. This information ‘accrued to us’ from a fellow passenger who seemed to understand the railway announcement.

(The phrase ‘accrued to us’ made the previous sentence grammatically incorrect.)

Meanwhile, a cause to celebrate. It was Diwali season, and therefore a large bunch of the people on the train were students. The College Student is a different breed of the human being. The female College Student being a very interesting species. I had the ample opportunity to observe a few of those from close quarters.

To our right, there was a group of MIT Engineering students. (And yeah, that’s another ‘variety’ of the college student breed. And damn it, I hate them…)

They were all asking everyone (read as ‘me’) where the train was going to leave. Being a college student myself, I reckon only I was equipped to speak in their language.

(Adults face a genuine problem. Like, I mean, like, oh man, like, you know, like, if college students, I mean, like, you know, like, speak like this, like, I mean, like, then, like, it’s, I mean, you know, like, oh man (insert giggle here), it is difficult to, oh man, like, understand, like, isn’t it?)

( Tired of brackets? )

And it was amidst such utter chaos and confusion that the train I had been waiting for arrived, at around seven thirty. Of course, we got this information from a guy (who had a rather sumptuous belly and his face radiated an odd sense of contentment about it) who suddenly began chasing the AS-2 bogie with a vengeance.

(Once again the childish urge to give the guy a nice and sharp poke in his belly, just to see how he would heave and let out a mammoth sigh, similar to the sound of an out-of-commission steam engine being revived, quite against its mechanical desire, after seventy five years for the railway minister’s entertainment.)

And that is where chapter two of this madness begins…

(And such other statements that serve as ineffective and irritating advertisements of a possible review which may appear sometime shortly, urging you desperately to keep your eyes open for it and read it when I publish it, but actually ensuring that neither of it happens, thereby resulting in the misfortune that my first-time reader would never really read me frequently, unless he/she wishes to give his/her child a lesson in bad, boring, non-stylish, meaningless, dragging and stupid writing, in a bid to improve on the child’s high school essays, or if you want me to be more optimistic, in a bid to try and ensure those essays don’t rot to hell as a result of reading my reviews without parental guidance, and such other statements that will generally look stupid at the end of an already pretty stupid review, of course, not forgetting to mention that this is an extremely long sentence and since I don’t take in a new breath till my current sentence gets over and I start a new one, it becomes pretty obvious that I’ve gone a violent shade of blue, not forgetting to mention the retching sounds of a suffocating man that are engulfing the internet café here, so I guess I’ll just insert a full stop somewhere random---.)

(Ah… I love abrupt ends)!
"
3,"Indian railways - This is definately one gift from the British that we

wouldn't want to stop thanking them for. That elaborate network which

operates through the 30 states never fails to bewilder me. It's simply

amazing! It wouldn't be an overstatement to say that Indian railways are

one of the most efficiant in the world. So what if Europe has the best

looking trains, and Japan has the fastest! The costs are equally royal!

The distances are equally short, and the public is equally deciplined!

Indians travel from the southern most tip to the far northerly in roughly

500 bucks, that's lesser than 10 pounds by the way! The reasonable

fares are a huge convininece for the poor and middle class to explore

far away terrains of the country. And the past 10 years have seen a

revolution in the reservation system! Now you can book your ticket from

anywhere to anywhere from anywhere! Also the online reservation

system has taken up in a big way.

There are definately some minuses too, but so what? Which system is

perfect? The train timings are frivolous and unpredictable some times.

The filth in the ordinary class compartments is beyond verbal description.

The loos in a shockingly lurid state! All these faults should undoubtedly

attributed to the public, who refuse to mend their manky and shoddy ways

of public conduct. And the government refuses to take serious action

against them!

Apart from these hitches, I must say that the railway system is

applaudable! Despite the distances and the topography, the show goes

on!"
3,"Indian railways are the largest in the world now but we do not have fastest trains in the world. We do not have under ground trains (sub way) except in two cities, Calcutta and Delhi with a very limited distance operation.

I was so much fascinated with rail ''gadi'' as a boy that I wanted to become rail engine driver and this ambition carried on even when I was doing my college. As fate would have I could not become an engine driver.

The railways carried Mahatma Gandhi all over India. And it also carried his assassin Godse.

The most surprising fact is that all the rail way lines that we see today are laid by British. Since the freedom in 1947 we did not put a single railway line independent of the presently existing one laid by the British except one line measuring 60 km from Bibinagar to Nadikudi in Andhra Pradesh during Mr. Narishimha Rao as Prime Minister !

India can boast of Konkan railway on Western Ghats which was somehow completed after 20 years and most of the money was collected in the form of BONDS from the general public. This is the only one I think independently executed in the sector of railways but at the same time it can not be called as a parallel railway line which can dispense with the British laid railways from any point to any point.

It shows the govt. utter disregard for the railways. It has always been a milking cow for the government. They ( govt) rake in the moolah but give back very less. It is the biggest public sector industry with the highest employment.

Railways were one important part of the freedom of the country itself. India had 60 different kingdoms ruled by so called ''royals'' who were in fact polishing the boots of the British. They were the only people who did not participate in the freedom struggle. India is also vast country. Entire Briton and France put together is smaller than Andhra and Tamil Nadu put together !!

In such a country integration is very important and much more during British raj and freedom struggle.

I think that Indian Railways unified the country and still even today it should be the focus point for national integration.One of the national integration methods can be that of the recruitment for railways should be at all India level and not at regional level.

But exactly what we are doing ?

Bihar did not allow railway exams to be conducted because applicants from other sates came there to take the exam.

In Bombay ( Mumbai) shivasainiks did not allow the applicants even to alight from the train. They beat up poor applicants with canes. May be they were good , in Bihar they tried to molest a girl applicant on the platform itself. A columnist ( Swaminathan Ankaleshwara Iyer ) wrote in TOI that the girl was actually mob raped by arsonists and hooligans who flooded the platform and it went on until the police rescued her. But what we all could see on TV was that mobs beating up and tearing the robes of girls on a stranded train on the platform somewhere in Bihar.

Political parties and their chamchas (whom they call as political workers) are making a mockery of Indian Railways. Do they really know what national integration is ?

Those nations who really want to see a divided India should do only one thing. They should use Indian railways as the vehicle. But as God would have it,. Those divisive forces do not have such a brain ?

How the Indian railways work is really a mystery. It always fascinates me.

At one time I was coming from Vijay Wada to Warangal. At the counter the clerk ( you would lose your interest in your life if you talk to them) gave me a ticket to Warangal for a train called GT. I got in to it. After seeing the Warangal station I realized that it would not stop there or in the next station. 150 km after I could get down and to pay a price for that.

At another time they dutifully issued a ticket to me to Tirupathi via a connecting train. But the connecting train already left Vijayawada to tirupathi by time the train that carried me reached there. But the railway authorities are real genius ( most of them recruited through reservation ) , they asked all of the poor souls like me to get in to another train. We all us found later that it would not go to Tirupathi !!!. All of the passengers who were crammed in to the general compartment like me ( the way Jews were crammed in to trains by Nazis) understood or taken advise by some railways employee or other experts ,that we should get down at a nearby station to Tirupathi and from there we should get in to a bus. After that entire horrible journey and because I reached one day late my boss took a resignation letter from me. That finished my job in Tirupathi.

Two foreigners who came to India just to see India as it is and not a Taj Mahal or jumma masjid , devised a great plan. According to that they should travel in the local trains of Bombay ( to see real India). Needless to say what happened.

They declared on the BBC that politicians are not running this country.

Gods are running this country !!

(Please understand that the above foreigners story is a joke on railways)"
3,"Indian Railways

Welcome to the largest railway network among all the nations. And for a country which is close on heels of being the most populated nation in the whole world.

Close your eyes.

What do you see?

~ I see a vast sea of people of all shapes and sizes, coming in and out of a railway station.

~ I see coolies(porters) in their red attires arguing over the amount paid to them by the passengers.

~ I see platforms. Where do I need to go? I have done a few trekking trips but once I go past those foot over bridges and land on one of the platforms only to be told that there have been last minute changes to where my train would actually arrive, I tell myself “With such wonderful settings in the heart of the city, do I actually need to go searching for a trekking site?”

~ I see trains with their mammoth engines whistling their arrival or departure.

~ Constantly blaring loudspeakers with a programmed voice of a lady asking for my attention every now and then, announcing the arrivals, the departures, the delays…oh,it never ever stops. But then, how would you know?

~ I hear a commotion as soon as a train arrives. People jostling and shoving past each other. I hear a brawl that has brewed over a large piece of luggage that a passenger is trying to push inside an already packed compartment. If you thought that it was more than the place could handle, you were wrong. Some more arrive on the scene. I mean both passengers and luggages.

~ I see several stalls- some selling chai, paani etc., some magazine stalls which sell less and are thronged more, some fruit vendors , and some selling just about anything.

~ I see beggars. Where else would they get such a vast source of income?

Now, the journey begins. For those who aren’t aware of the way Indian Railways functions. Let me tell you – I don’t know. Even God doesn’t know. But yes, it helps me and my family reach the 1000 miles away from home and then back which I don’t know how else would have been possible. For those, who still want to know (as if there really are some), let me tell you.

~You need to know where you are and where you want to go.

~You need to find out among all the scores of trains (thanks to the new trains announcements that each hounourable Railway Minister makes in his/her Railway budget speech every year) that can take you there, which one runs on the day you want to depart and whether it suits your timing, budget(well, those who just abhor the janta trains because they are as slow as a snail and run as erratically as a drunken ragamuffin, always have the Rajdhanis, Shatabdis and the other of the same ilk), and above all whether its AVAILABLE. Else, you would just see lingo like WL196 and RAC78 on your travelling ticket. And that will keep you on the tenterhooks till the last moment. And you would be thronging those charts on the boards with more anxiousness than you did when you went to see your board exams results. Hurray! One exults. He is in. Are you? If not, never mind. Just jump in. There are some white collared, black coated guys you would encounter on the train. For the sake of letting you know, they are called TTEs. TTE what? Yes TTE. Travelling Ticket Examiner. Talk to them. What do you talk to them? Well, if you don’t know what to talk to them, just show them your travelling ticket. They would do the talking.

~ Once you are in, you would just like to know who all will be your companions for the next 8 or 12 or 20 or 40 or yes, yes, even 64 hours(Gosshhhh! Two and a half days sitting inside a tinned roof , looking outside those windows into the length and breadth of your vast motherland). All kinds of people. From people who just snore past the entire journey to the ones who would discuss everything and anything under the sun and make no sense at all. Some who would read “Suhaag aur Bandook” to the ones who would eat everything that come their way.

~ Don’t ask me what is the best way to travel on Indian Railways? But one thing I would strictly advise against is – Travelling alone. Some people tell me they prefer traveling alone. Just climb atop their upper berths and do whatever they please – read, rant (silently), dream, sleep, eat…But doing that for the hours and sometimes days together becomes a pain.

Bottom line

Indian Railways maybe a nightmare for some. It maybe the lifeline for some. Some hardly care. But, whatever you may think of it, living in India, you cannot survive without it. If you thought I was exaggerating , just close your eyes and imagine there was no Indian Railways. What do you see?"
4,"I am a regular traveler in country’s prestigious train “RAJDHANI EXPRESS”. I normally move towards Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai. Recently, I traveled to Bhubaneshwar also. There is no doubt that these trains provide a certain level of comfort and saves the time in journey.

Drinking water is necessary to survive and doctors prescribe minimum 7 ltr of water intake every day. In Rajdhani express, there is provision of two bottles (2 liters) only, for duration of 24-30 hours of journey. Catering Manager advice to purchase more water but without any bill.

The service level provided in Rajdhani express should be above these small issues especially when a considerable amount is deducted in the name of providing “quality meals”.

In recent news appeared in newspapers informs that one political leader, transferred from Patna is provided 2-3 times of normal meals in “Tihar Jail” as per his diet. However, Railways do not provide sufficient water and diet in Rajdhani Express to the passengers even after charging a huge amount as fair.

I understand that this is a small issue and can be resolved by issuing a fresh circular to Rajdhani Express staff to provide sufficient water and meals to the passengers. There should not be any economical issues. To make it public, please publish this circular in all newspapers and keep it on the website of Indian Railways."
1,"Title : No No no No remedy!!!!

Review : I am reminded of an anecdote here or rather a joke I heard somewhere.

Once a delegation of former Soviet Union Railways came to India to study the Indian Railways. They stayed in India for quite sometime and when they were returning home they were asked about their impressions. They said a big change have come over them- when they were asked what was that- they said that being a communist country we never believed in God but after seeing the way the Indian Railway functions our belief in a supreme power above has strenghthened.

Such is the sad state of affairs. Once your money has gone to Indian Railways you only have one option either to make use of that money by travelling or to forget about it. The refund process is so tedious that an ordinary guy does not go for it and if he does a pleasant surprise awaits him because by the time he does get an intimation of refund he has forgotton all about it.

The refund intimation is followed by another tedious procedure when you have to present it at the nearest railway station. You will know so much about railway procedure that you would become a walking encyclopedia of outdated stupid rules dating back to British times.

The condition of the railway stations is such that I shudder to think what the foreigners think about us.

Indians once they have travelled anyplace here by trains. One thing I give to the railways that sleeper class is damn cheap but since I've never travel by that class what use is it to me or to any of the mouthshut fraternity for I do not believe that any of them must be using this class.

I do not really know what to say of this class it is not fit for animals to travel in. The toilets are unsable you have all kinds of filthy people going in and out all the time but probably that is all excusable.

Now let us talk about AC III and AC II and AC chair car .

=First of all all the faresare unjustifiably high . You shell out about Rs.900/- for AC II for travel from Lucknow to Delhi whereas you can take an Indian Airlines flight for Rs. 1250 only. How about that and then the facilities are nothing to speak of.

=The toilets are as usual dirty and unusable . The blankets and all are dirty and stink. Nobody comes to ask for food. You have to hunt for the guys to give you food. in this respect kashi vishwanath is an exception here is a good food service for you.

=Former prime minister shri Atal Behariji gave a wonderful gift to the Lucknowites as well as Delhites. He bought a whole train from Germanywhich is known as the Swarn Shatabdi. It is probably the best Chair car train in India. All the coaches as well as the engine is german.

About an year back it was a wonderful experience. The food was delicious the service was even better than that of an airlines. The train was right on time. Now with the change of government at the centre look what happens:

A few weeks back I was travelling with my wife to Delhi. In the evening food was served to us , it was so bloody chilly I did not know what to do , my wife had hiccups I requested the waiter to give us another bottle of mineral water he said that since you have had your alloted quota of one bottle you wont get more now what was I supposed to do about my wife in a train running at 140 kms /hour.

I told the waiter that I would make a complaint he challenged me to do my worst. Then I complained to the supervisor who immediately gave one bottle extra but by that time the damage was done and my wife was ill for a week afterwards and how did this happen , so far as I recollect about an year back the caterer was private now the railways themselves are doing the catering and you all know how government departments are.


I felt sick and sad that the most premier train in India has come to this.

=Talking about ticket collectors, well they are worst then the neighbourhood police guys.All they are interested in is making some money and well ''politeness'' is the last thing you can expect from them they are more like jail wardens and the perfect recipe to spoil your mood.

One thing good about the railways recently is the online booking system but even the attractive part of that seems to be ending . Previously getting the berth of your choice was one thing that motivated you to book tickets online now that facility has been withdrawn and well the service charges if you book by credit card is huge, simply huge.

Last thing - would you believe that reservation office in Delhi does not have credit card payment facility at all Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha ahh!!!!!!"
1,"INDIAN RAILWAYS

World's biggest rail network which

# Always cares for employees. (for customers - God is there to take care!!!)

# Provides up to 5 times more tickets then capacity. (for general class coaches)

# Keeps platforms, waiting rooms, tracks and toilets equally clean.

# Helps country in fighting with biggest problem ? ?Population Blast? by throwing

Rajdhani express off the track, by playing face to face collision game with real

trains.

# Which waive offs platform tickets for beggars, animals etc on humanitarian

ground and allow them to freely interact with customers.

# Which selects and deputes extra ordinary staff ?where everybody believes in

?more thinking and less working?. They follow ? Simple living, high thinking and

less working?.

In my opinion Indian Railways is the PSU which deserves privatization on top priority. Country is not only getting bad name but also loosing big revenue due to extreme mismanagement in this department.

Because of my nature of job, I am a frequent user of Railways since last 10 years and there are many experiences which forced to write this review.

Mismanagement and solutions can be summarized as below-

# Ticketing and Reservation : Overcrowded windows with inefficient clerks. Reservation form requires unnecessary information, which is not required. We all fill our address and phone no on reservation form. Please let me know if any time railway has used it for any purpose. In my opinion only name is enough (like booking in airlines).

SUGGESTION: Tickets and reservation counters can be spread throughout the country and petrol pumps, post offices, shopping malls, hotels, hospitals etc can be used in the form of a network. IRCTC can easily execute it through their e-ticketing facility (which is at present not useful for those who are not having credit card or e-banking).

--Unreserved tickets can be sold easily by above proposed network like recharge coupons of cellular phones. Railway can control the misuse by collecting/destroying the tickets efficiently after the use.

--This will dramatically reduce the crowd at railway station ticket windows and people would be able to get tickets/reservations easily from a smiling clerk.

# Enquiry window : Only one per station.( That too in the hands of any frustrated clerk who is more interested in passing shift time instead of helping customers).

SUGGESTION: More no of enquiry counters in peak hours with young, efficient, trained staff which should be equipped with proper software and hardware for prompt and proper response. Continuous display of general updated information above enquiry windows will also help. At present many people believe that porters are best source for information. Railway should take a lesson and should depute some young and energetic officers/clerks on this task. They should follow a defined dress code and should be equipped with communication devices (walkie-talkie or cellular) for collecting updated information. These people can work as guide or as mobile enquiry counters or even as customer care executives.

# Tele- enquiry: Dial 131, if somebody picks ? you are lucky.

SUGGESTION:Look towards call centers or 24 hour help-line numbers of various banking, telecom and other service organizations. Instead of wasting time, money and energy on improving this my suggestion is that Railway must outsource this to any good call center.

# Displays at stations regarding train nos and schedules: Most of the electronic displays are in poor maintenance conditions and others are also of very poor quality. Either screens are dead or information is not updated. Same the case is with LED indicators. No body is there to update and maintain. Why they waste money on this when nobody is there to take care?

SUGGESTION: Outsource it and see the results.

# Public Addressing Audio System: Very-very poor quality on most of the stations. Even after putting full concentration, sometimes it becomes very difficult to understand the message because of poor quality of speakers and microphones.

SUGGESTION: High quality of systems with proper loudness, treble, bass and proper speaker locations can be installed in consultation with Acoustic experts.

# House keeping and Cleanliness: Horrible in all respects. No need to explain.

Suggestion: Outsource it as soon as possible. Give authority to any third agency not only to upgrade and maintain platform, retiring rooms and coaches but also for collecting the fines from defaulters.(Then only we can expect dust free, neat and clean platforms and coaches with some flowerpots and show pieces to welcome us, we can see application of room-fresheners/air-cleaners in retiring rooms and coaches, we can expect projection screens showing news/music on platforms and in retiring rooms with proper and adequate sitting arrangements. Any agency can do it for selected stations and can recover the cost by displaying advertisements hoardings on platforms and by running ads on screens. Even higher class passengers can also be charged nominally for the same.

# Confusing platform numbers: Go to Old Delhi station and you will find platform no 1A (?) . At some stations main platform is having last no. There is no standard criteria. Can be standardize easily on the basis of main entry.

# Standardization of platforms: Uniform rules can be applied for UP and DOWN trains (or even and odd no of trains) and for Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains for their platforms. It will help all the commuters specially who travels with heavy luggage.

# Pasting of passenger list on coach door: which doesn?t remain on place after train reaches to next station and you can see passengers running around for TT to locate their seats/berths.

SUGGESTION: Transparent fiber sheet protection can be adopted.

# Standardization of coach location on platform: Can easily achieved by little exercise.

# Availability of trolleys and Control on porters: Trolleys/Powered trolleys can be provided on chargeable basis. It will be a great facility to commuters and additional revenue for railways.

# Availability of public phones on platforms: Very less STD/PCO and forget about functioning of coin operated phones.

SUGGESTION: Situation can be improved by putting ZIP-Phones in sufficient quantity across the rail network with the help of various telecom players of the country. Ad display on ZIP will give maintenance revenue. After all customer pays for each call.

# Sitting arrangements on platforms: Insufficient no of chairs with poor maintenance.

SUGGESTION: As discussed above in point Housekeeping.

# Quality control (Eatables): Quality of eatables available at platforms clearly tells ? we are being cheated. Try a cup of tea at any platform.

SUGGESTION : Strong and honest administration or open competition by removing license policy for caterers.

Apart from above following can also be focused-

# Mobile charging facilities in trains

# Converting all day trains into chair car trains

# Optimization of manpower and infrastructure

# Making platform height up to the coach door

# Punctuality of trains

Above situation clearly shows ?

?EVERYTHING IS MISMANAGED AT INDIAN RAILWAYS?

and railways can?t improve on it because they are not made for customer care, they are not made for business, they are not made for growth, they are not made for productivity, they are not made for efficiency, they are not made for innovativeness..??THEY ARE HERE FOR TIME PASS.

And ??privatization is suggested.

3,"I have been travelling by Indian Railways extensively in Andhra since I was born. The trips took were mostly touching Vijayawada, Vishakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Tirupati, Chennai, Calicut & Bangalore.

The various phases I observed were:

Late 70?s and early eighties:

Coal engines ? Single track ? no safety ? dirty & smelly ? hard beds ? more unreserved coaches ? Lots of beggars ? fun to travel ? food packed from home was the best option - all trains running late all the time.

Late eighties to early nineties:

Diesel engines & electric trains ? Double track ? no ?safety ? still dirty & smelly ? not so hard beds ? less unreserved coaches ? lots of beggars ? fun to travel ? food packed from home or you get sick - few trains running late all the time

Late nineties to now

Lots of electric tracks but still using diesel on some high traffic routes like Bangalore ?tirupati, - Double track ? still no safety ? still dirty & smelly except a few trains like rajadhani, godavari & some intercities. ? not so hard beds ? almost no unreserved coaches compared to the volume of unreserved passengers ? still lots of beggars and eunuchs ? slightly less fun to travel ? food can be had at railways if it is foiled rather than served on tray or paper or leafs but still you might get sick - most trains running on time most of the time ? website with most relevant information.

In 30 years if the railways have progressed this little, that is because other modes of transportation are not available to most places. Only now bus services (especially Volvo & private services) are making inroads in a major way as a preferred way of travelling due to better roads connecting cities.

In most countries where we see ultra fast trains with onetime arrivals the railways improved because they had stiff competition from other modes of transport like airlines, buses and cars. In India we never had airlines for the middle class, nor did we have good roads or good solidly built buses or cars. But that is changing slowly so this should make railways more competitive.

Already there are proposals to introduce bullet trains. But railways should first concentrate on efficiency with online bookings, taking security & complaints within coaches very seriously, easy access to stations, better ergonomically designed coaches with more services to high volume destinations.

I still like the railways for their cheapest services and connecting every nock and corner of the country.

They will have cut the prices on the A/C coaches or else soon there will be no takers for their A/C couches.
"
3,"Indian Railways are a very big organization. It is impossible to cover all its activities in one review. For the purpose of this review I have selected railway catering services. In other words I will try to examine how safe is the food served to passengers travelling by trains run by Indian railways.


Passengers consume various food items during their journey. Many passengers carry with them food items prepared at home and consume them during the journey. Then there are vendors and food stalls/plazas approved by railways who supply food items on platforms and also on trains. Food items are also served in refreshment rooms on platforms.

On many trains food items are served by pantry car. There are also a large number of unapproved vendors serving food items on platforms and on the trains. Then are the food items served by Indian Railways Catering Organization. One such organization is Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) which is a public sector company set up and fully owned by the Ministry of Railways. IRCTC runs catering services through their own employees and also through contractors.

If you ask passengers about the quality of food served and manner of serving during their journey you will find a mixed response. Some will have complaints to make and some will express general satisfaction. All these responses are based on the fact whether they fell ill or not after the journey. Most of the passengers in India will also say that once you are in journey you can not expect home like food.

Hardly you will find a passenger who had examined the issue from quality and safety point of view. I accept that for a long time I also used to think like this. But due to my current profession of providing training and consultancy on management systems including food safety management systems, I have gained a large experience on this aspect of quality and safety of food. Through this review I wish to share my experience with MS members.

If you visit the Website of IRCTC, you will only find material related to booking of tickets and a horde of advertisements. No direct reference is available about catering although the name of the organization has the word catering. At the bottom of Home Page you will find a toolbar giving three links. Indianrailways.gov.in is the official Website of Indian railways. It also does not provide any information on catering. Then there is a link to ?Air Tickets to India?. In the middle you will find the link to ?Other IRCTC activities?.

When you click on this, you will see a list of these other activities. One out of these is ?Empanelment for on board catering in Trains, Management of Food Plazas and Refreshment Rooms over Indian Railways?. Click on this and you will see an advertisement ?A Grand Business Opportunity? stating terms and conditions for empanelment. One of these conditions is ? ?In addition, the organization must have strict quality control mechanism with mandatory external food quality and hygiene audit comparable with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) or equivalent Good Industry Practices.? Friends this is the result of my extensive search ? the only reference I could find on Indian Railway Websites on food safety.

Now let me talk something about this food safety. Food safety management systems are based on the concept of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP). In simple language we can describe it as ?ugaane se khaane tak? or in English as ?from field to dining table?. In other words under this system quality and safety of food is ensured at every stage of procurement of raw materials, production, packing, transportation, storage and consumption.

This is ensured through systems of various practices, such as, Good Agricultural Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Laboratory Practices, Good Hygienic Practices. Safety means preventing any form of contamination in food ? Physical, Chemical, Microbiological. If you remember incidents of finding pesticides in packaged drinking water and other cold drinks ? it was chemical contamination. In case of living organisms found in Cadbury chocolates- it was microbiological contamination.

During my recent trip to Chandigarh on Shatabdi Express I noticed that the paper placed in the food tray had this matter printed on it ? ?Indian Railway?s First ISO 9001: 2000 & HACCP Certified Catering Organization?. Paper packets containing spoon, fork, knife, and tea kit were also printed with this statement. It was a pleasant surprise for me. It is a matter of pride for any Indian that Indian Railways are giving so much importance to safety of food being served to passengers on the train. It has also aroused my interest, as it is not an easy job to Implement ISO 9001and HACCP on a running train.

The first thing I wanted to know was the name of the agency, which has audited the systems and certified them to ISO 9001and HACCP standards. I tried my level best but could not learn the name of that organization. Waiters belong to a contractor?s organization and were not aware of what ISO 9001and HACCP mean. So was the case with train executives.

The manner of serving food was also not of required standards. It has killed my joy. I wanted to find out more. I sent e-mail to IRCTC but received no reply. I searched the Websites and found only a passing reference to food safety.

All this has created a doubt in my mind about the credibility of this claim of Indian Railways, being first ISO 9001:2000 and HACCP certified organization, and also the quality and safety of food. There are so many items served, tea, sugar, milk powder, samosa, biscuits, toffees, butter, jam, tomato ketchup, cooked vegetables, dal, rice, soup, roti. All these items are supplied by different organizations.

How their quality and safety are ensured. Also how the personal hygiene is ensured when people are not aware of the system. I do not want to spoil pleasure of eating in Shatabdi Express but this is the situation I thought I should share with you.

I am still searching and any information if found I will share with you. In the meantime, carry your own food even if the charge of food served in Shatabdi Express is included in your ticket."
4,"Not EveryBody knows INDIAN Railways is the largest organization and a single network in India and Asia.

Infact Indian Railways is the carrier of biggest number of travelers dailay in the world. The huge network, number of employees and huge number of passengers per employee is the basis for making this such a great service and a remarkable organization. So many trains , improving routes and huge traveler groups are the general features of this network.

Why does this huge network not prosper. Do we know the real cost of travel per passenger in a train is sufficcient for the Railways to gather funds for a new train on the same route. Still the big network corporation is running into Losses.

Some body in the Railways authority of India have to realise what canbe improved on major station other than the metros to make this service a pleasure and trustworthy. Many of the trains are running on time and connecting to the metros in a disciplined fashion.

But a large number of trains are known for being late always.

That they never reach late.. Some hard facts are that if you travel from Delhi to Hawra via Patna.. you have 90 % chances to get robbed. that if you travel from a station other than metro even on a reserved seat / birth you are likely forced to share your space with unconfirmed / unticketed passengers.

That if you have boarded a train you can easily travel on a shatabadi train to Punjab unticketed but paying the fare even if the people at the ticketing counter dont get a confirmed space on the same train.

That if you do the above you still dont pay anything to the Railways and the staff on the coach is minting thousands everyweek on selected stations..

That if the authorities get on to it they can easily trace such unfair activities.

That if you are waitlisted and have shown some interest in the interests ofthe TICKET BAABUyou can easily get a space in same or higher compartment. with or without paying a different in upgrade to the Railways account. the Ticket baabuwill take care of it

That you travel if you take care of him.

That you could travel faster train in the last moment if you get space and reach the destination station and get a refund for the train that reaches 3 hours late and for which you had paid extra. The routes and costs are many a times illogical. you spend more to get less if you pay to Railways....

That you spend little more to the Ticket Baabu and you enjoy your travel although there may be someone who needs your seat / birth more than you.

That even if you deserve your seat more .. on the upcoming station you will have to face a tug of war with the Jaats / Biharis (not the jaats / biharis of the region but for the obvious reasons that these people are bullies without sense.)

That if you are a SHAREEF AADMI you dont belong to the Railway services. better take a flight.

DELHI VIDYUT BOARD is an example of loosing money for years ... running in losses for decades and now after Privatization the same network has found ways to logically gather revenue and they are REALLY making huge profits.

Once you got a job in a govt department , that is not the end you need to earn that Job by doing the due service to the same. Wish someone thinks about the irony that the huge network which could accumulate revenue is loosing to its own employees. Wish the employees understood what worth it is ..

Lest if they did not get that job.

Now go to work."
5,"Hi Everyone,

Ever since the controversial decision to make Mr. Laloo Prasad yadav to make the minister of railways was taken, the minister of railways have been making inroads.

Make no mistake, Laloo yadav has been named in many corruption charges and till today the opposition leaves no stone unturned in accusing the government of inducting him into the ministry.

What has Laloo done since he took over as Railways minister?

Since he took over this ministry Laloo has made various changes (though very minor in nature yet effective) and has stressed the importance of having lassi and other milk products to be sold in the stations and not only that, he has conducted surprise checks in the stations which is something that every minister needs to be doing today.

The railway budget proposed certain important changes such as e-procurement , nominal increase in parcel rates, measures to increase passenger security, unreserved ticketing system being a few in the budget.

Now arises a big question as to what the minister of railways needs to do in the near future?

First of all, the connectivity towards eastern states especially needs to increase in the near future. Normally the connectivity is restricted to only Guwahati (though other parts such Itanagar,Shillong etc..are connected to some extent) and not to other parts such as aizawl,agarthala,though the geographical conditions are not that favorable there.

The government needs to bring in the Railways footprint in these areas also as it will increase the connectivity of these places with other parts of the country.

Secondly, the departure and the arrivals of the trains needs to tightened and trains must ensure that they come on time and this is very important as Railways form a major revenue earner for the country and our countrymen still trust the railways and its high time that this organization start delivering, not just promise but in reality too.

The efforts made by the Railways minister are surely in the right direction and let us hope that this is a sustained effort and continues even in the years to come and take Railways on the right track.

''Laloo Bihari hamar relway minastarwa banat hai babua!''

2,"This is my experience regarding parking my bike near the besant nagar's railway reservation counter. Two days before, when I went in the early morning to book railway tickets to nearby besant nagar railway reservation counter.

I have parked my bike in the parking space alloted. We need to pay three rupees for parking our bike in the parking slot. I was asking for a token to the guy who is responsible for issuing them. He said that I can pay it when I return from booking. I returned from booking and then gave three rupees to the corresponding person. He has taken that and said that I can leave. I got somewhat shocked and asked him about the token (red colour slip on which the bike's number has to be written). He takes a token which is torn and gave that to me ( these tokens can be found on the near by premesis where people do normally leave them once they pay the money). I denied and asked him to give me a fresh token. He argued with me and asks me to complain against him to the higher authorities. Infact, you shall get surprised if I say that he had shown me the phone numbers of the higher authorities. After 10 to 15min of argument with this person, he issued a new token.

These persons do not issue the fresh tokens and put all the money they receive into unofficial accounts. The bike's number has to be written on the token and that has to be given to the bike's owner who is parking the bike. This has to be avoided. People who are parking their bikes in the parking slots, take the token and get the bike's number written on the token, so that this shall not happen to others. And before they leave the premesis, please tear the token into pieces, so that they cannot issue these tokens to others by just scribbling the previous number.

It is we who have to take care about all these small issues. The same situation may be prevailing over all the parts of the country. These seem to be small issues.. But, this way of thinking should not be there in the society. Everyone is responsible for his/her work. Making these people understand about their work and their responsibilities is the main task that is left behind.... we also have the right to oppose these activities.

I hope, I have expressed my view in a logical manner and I would have conveyed my suggestion in a proper manner. Thanks for reading my review.

The (in)famous Jackfruit Letter There is a very persistent legend about a letter purportedly written by an irate railway passenger suffering on account of the premature departure of a train. The letter is claimed to have been written around 1909 (a precise date of July 2, 1909 is also sometimes claimed), addressed to the Divisional Office of the East Indian Railway or the Transportation Superintendent at Sahibganj, West Bengal, or to the Railway Board. The letter is said to have been discovered in railway records in West Bengal, or in the Railway Board's archives in New Delhi, or to have been published in the August 1909 issue of 'Indian Railways' (published by the Railway Board). It is very likely that this letter is a legend or joke, even if it was reproduced in an official publication. The text of the letter follows.



Dear Sir,

I am arrive by passenger train at Ahmedpore station, and my belly is too much full of jack fruit. I am therefore went to privy, Just as I doing the nuisance, that guard making whistle blow for train to go off and I am running with lotah in one hand and dhotie in the next hand. I am fall over and expose my shockings to man, females, woman on platform. I am get leaved at Ahmedpore station.

This too much bad, if passenger go to make dung, that dam guard no wait train 5 minutes for him. I am therefore pray your honour to make big fine on that guard for public sake, otherwise I am making big report to papers.

1,"Hi friends......

I got my tickets booked in Rajdhani for the 15th of June from New Delhi to Kanpur station....

Initially the status of the ticket was:-

W/L - 8 .... W/L - 4

Later when I reached delhi from bombay from the sahara flight and went to check the status of my ticket it showed ....

W/L - 8 ...... W/L - 6

IS it posssible?

U only tell me....

I have only seen waiting list decreasing but this is the first time I say the waiting list increasing.

Then I went to the officials to ask them about the waiting list as I saw the above status on the internet...

But on their system also the same was displayed...

I asked them 2 give an explaination for this but they failed to do so...

They told me that I should look at the waiting list 8 and not at waiting list 4 although officially it means that first the waiting list was 8 later since the passengers cancelled their tickets so it became 4.....

But they wer not ready to understand.,...

I asked them if I cancel my ticket which is confirmed and if I try 2 get back the same ticket then it is possible and they answered no......

so I asked them again that the same has happened wit me as mine waiting list has increased.....

I did wrote a written complain but no response have yet come from them.......

you only tell me if it was fair enough.......

it means that if our ticket is confirmed then it might come 2 waiting list...........

i did went thru a horrible experience on indian railways and I do salute them for whatever mistake they did and forbidded me from travelling......

I am bewildered at this and feel shameful tooooo..."
5,"Booking online is a real good service introduced by the railways.

I booked the ticket from Bombay to Baroda online, and received the ticket the next day by courier.

The booked tickets are delivered on time, and really appreciate the service by our worlds biggest network railways.

The only catch is you need to have a credit card to book the tickets(I feel this is quite good which will allow us to book the tickets individually with secure system)

Now I have started booking the Rly tickets, avoiding the agents and long ques to the Rly stations.I even booked ticket to my old parents in india when I was abroad, and made it delivered to their home.

All the appreciation to our Indian Railways."

Everything about it is fast. The tickets delivered to your doorstep the very next day.

You can book tickets for your near and dear from some other place and have the ticket mailed to them.

The best thing about it is while standing in the counter and handling cash , fear of missing anything is always there while in online ticketing there is nothing of this sort and you can book the ticket from you house or just an internet cafe.

I have used this many times and always found it to be more easy than the traditional way...

try and let me know ..

Nope, I wouldn’t dare talk about ‘zindagi ka safar’[life’s journey] at my tender age. But I'm here to share the actual‘suffer’ of travelling by Indian Railways . With my ample experience of up and downing New Delhi-Bangalore, I automatically qualify to comment, rate and be opinionated about the Railways and their system. For history, facts, figures, timetable and routings please refer to your local railway guide [or their ever showing ‘please wait’ website]I am only here to take you on a journey, with some musical interludes to add on the entertainment value to the otherwise rather monotonous trip.

Journey

Jaipur se nikli gaadi Dilli chale..[Train has left Jaipur to Delhi..]

Read it as Delhi towards Bangalore (and vice versa on return trip). Usually its Friday evenings that I board the KK Express from Delhi that will finally dump in Bangalore on coming Sunday afternoon. So for the whole 42 hours [can u believe it?]that train is virtually my whole world.[How I wish I’d that helicopter of Shahrukh’s in K3G, to fly in minutes and announce'Mein aa gayee hoon Maa'(I’m home mom)in typical filmi eshtyle or alternatively, my company taking care of my airfares even for personal holidays! Sigh!]Anyways, after tucking in securely your luggage and bidding farewells, the ‘suffering’ begins. Let’s talk one at a time.

People

Yeh kahaan aa gaye hum[Oh no!]

This is your first reaction to your co-passengers who sometimes are so buggingly irritating or irritatingly bugging.'Kahan jaa rahi ho beti? Kaun rehtha hein udhar? Shaadi ho gayi hein kya? Delhi mein akele rehthe ho? Kahan makaan liya hein? Kitna rent dete ho?..'[You really want me to translate all that nonsense?]Aaargh! And then there are others who literally bore your brains with their knowledge of politics, sports and what nots, even when you turn stone-deaf! But I must admit that besides the scenery outside your window, people around you are the most fascinating aspect of such travel. You get to see the real world as it truly is and in all diversity. Like

Akkad bakkad bambe bo.. assi, nabbe poore sou[1,2,3,4..100?]

The ‘akadnewale’[stiff-necked] railway staff come under this category. Most of them are under the impression that the train is their ancestral property and hauteur approach is the only way to deal with passengers. They also forget that they are paid for their jobs and are constantly under the assumption that they are doing a favour just by being there. Sample this. A conversation between a passenger and a staff member,

'Arey suno, could you get me a water bottle?' ' '

'Pantry mein tho miltha hoga?' 'Patha nahi'

'Kaise staff ho, phir kisse poonche?' 'Mera duty nahi saab''

'Growl..grunt..roar..grr' 'Bow wow..kyuin,kyyuin..snarl'

[Self explanatory, hope you got the picture!]

Agreed that such melodramatic encounters are entertaining and provide some comical relief, but often wears out on the patience level of co-travellers.

Batata Vada, Batata Vada..[Potato vada please!]

These are the ‘Bakasurs’[hogging demons] who can’t resist anything that passes them by. Fruits, chips, vada, paav bhaaji, idli, dosa, cutlet, soup, chocolate, cool drinks, peanuts, coffee, tea..woah!! Being blessed with an amazing appetite and extraordinary digestive system.

So gaya yeh jahan, so gaya aasmaan..[Zzz zzz zzz..]

The moment they get their berth, they fall into a deep slumber, totally ignorant of the roaring world surrounding them. These 'Kumbakarnas’[sleeping demons] can break any no. of Guinness records for the longest sleep hours. In fact, it’s a blessing to have such non-disturbing co-passengers as long as they don’t rock your world with their loud snores.

Ek rahen Eer, Ek rahen Bir, Ek rahen Patthe, aur.. [Gambler’s anthem]

Cards and more cards, play on! Simply amazing people who put casinos of Las Vegas to utter shame with their non-stop gambling!

Yahan ke hum sikander..[We are the Alexanders here ?]

These are the other most regular people on a train. They float in and out and include hawkers, beggars, coolies, hijrons [picked it from India today for hijra (eunuchs)].

Yeh kya ho raha hein..[What’s happening around?] And/or

Main aur meri tanhayee..[Leave me alone]

My kind of Boolean people here. Sometimes with keen observation on the happenings and others times happy to be left to their own plight, preferring to curl with a book or plug in that walkman and forget the rest of the world!

Food

Dal roti khao, prabhu ke gun gao..[eat bread and sing glory of the Lord]

What are these thick charred oily round things? I see, they are called poori. Are these funny looking awful tasting half-baked stuff vegetables? And that sour water.. but of course, curds! One has to still survive so you forcibly gulp down a morsel or two. Hope the dinner is better, vegetable ‘pulao’ they said. But where are the vegetables in this semi-cooked mass of rice? I paid Rs.32 for 3 pieces of carrot? My vegetarianism is killing me. Look at the neighbour he is enjoying his chicken biryani.. but hey, why is he running for the window.. throwing up? Ugh! Should I dare even think about how the ‘upma’ served for b/f will be? Remember, the worst part of a train journey is always food and if you did survive that, you’ll survive anything. After this, you expect me to speak about the berth, coach and loo? You must be joking!!

Destination

Manzilein abhi aur bhi hein..[When the hell do I get out of here?]

MP chala gaya kya? Have we touched Maharastra?Good..it’s just another day more. Ok, let me take a break from my music and reading. So peep out of the window.. admire mother nature [and eeks..people attending nature’s call?]Drink some coffee, tea, some coffee again and tea.. repeat as long as you don’t get acidity problems. Ahmednagar? How I wish my uncle hadn''t moved from here. It’s only 3 pm. Get down at next station, take a small walk on the platform, make faces at some monkeys around.AP kab aayega rey?Some late hour in the night, and between the mosquitoes and tick bites, you realise that the train is standing still. Signal crossings? 2 hours wait only?!Morning again.. wafts of idli, dosa smell.. must be Dharmavaram. So another 6 hours to go. Catch up with newspaper, your novel and may be one more cassette. Karnataka at last? But when will I reach Bangalore.

Main zindagi..har fikr ko duane mein udatha chala gaya..

[So I blew away all my tensions with the engine smoke huh?!]

Finally destination arrived. So what if you were only 3 hrs late, you got out alive & in one piece, be thankful.

I walk out of the station joyfully, though there is some nagging in the corner of mind that you’ll be back soon and for more ‘suffering.’

4,"The Indian Railways is a very important public sector unit of the Government of India. It is administered by the Ministry of Railways. It has a chequered history in India. It has promoted national integration in the country in its own way. The Indian Railways is the largest employer in India. Besides its employees, others who are benefitted by it are the porters, vendors, book stalls like The Wheeler in the north and The Higinbothams in the south.

I like its logo, inscribed with the words 'Indian Railways' and 'Bhartiya Rail' in Hindi. My friend Dr. Bhagwati Charan Mishra, a member of the Bihar Civil Service, was the member of the Rajbhasa Committee of the Indian Railways. He went round the country , in a Railway Saloon of course, and saw to it that the name of a Railway Station is written in Hindi on the two main sign boards of every station. Now you see the name of the Station written in the State language in the first line, in Hindi in the second line, and in English in the third line.

Apart from the important stations, there are also passenger halts where only the passenger trains stop. The Indian Railways work in close cooperation with the Department of Posts, which reaches every nook and corner of the country. In every mail and express train mail is caried in one specially designated compartment under the Railway Mail Service, or RMS in short. I had a cousin, who was a Sorter in the RMS, and he used to have train duty for two days every week. Once he took me to the RMS Compartment to show how the mail bag for our post office TYANDAKURA, in Kendrapara District, then in Cuttack District, was closed at Howrah RMS. I felt very important.

Before independence, there were the Bengal Nagpur Railways, Nizam Railways, etc., but after independence they were named as Eastern Railway, South-Eastern Railway, Northern Railway, Southern Railway, South Central Railway and the like. There is also the Konkan Railways, a new member in the family.

The Deccan Queen, between Bombay and Pune, was the fastest train in those days. Not now. Now there are many Superfast Trains criss-crossing the entire length and breadth of the country. The narrow gauge trains to Darjeling and Oooty are really very beautiful. So also the train to Shimla.

Moghul Sarai is the largest station in the country; next is Kharagpur. The local trains from Kharagpur to Howrah carry passengers and merchandise, besides maids who work as 'jhees' in Calcutta.

The Metro in Calcutta and Delhi are the pride of India. Very neat and clean and sophisticated.

Now a days there are AC First Class, AC 2 Tier and AC Three Tier coaches, besides the 3-Tier Sleeper coaches in all important mail and Express trains. Reservations for these are done well in advance by a country wide reservation network. And you can know the position of your reservation through the Railways Website in the Internet.

While presenting the Railway Budget, Minister Nitish Kumar has designated this year as the Passenger Amenities Year. Let us hope that we get hot delicious food cooked in the Pantry Cars, and served in the compartments with courtesy. Let us also hope that every important train has a library attached to it. Minister Nitish Kumar should do everything possible to see that the TTCs are trained to be less rude. I do not know how corruption could be prevented, unless there is cooperation from us, the passengers. This is also one of the jobs of the Railway Staff College, Baroda.

Rajdhani Expresses and Shatabdi Expresses are the pride of India.

The Howrah Bridge connects Calcutta with Howrah, but the Indian Railways connects one place with another with its characteristic sound 'Chhuk Chhuk, Chhuk Chhuk'.
"
1,"This article depicts my fresh experience both at reservation centre and in the train itself. The first bad experience happened with me in reservation office and second bad experience happened with very old couple (70+).

======================================================

1st : Maninagar - Ahemdabad , 9.45 AM 13 Feb 2003

======================================================

Train Numbers

I went to registration centre, I took form, obviously I cant remember the train number of all trains, but I wrote train name (Shatabdi exp) and requested officer to fill in the number (he has to search in computer which takes 1 second), still he said ''I dont know, you go and search and get it''. I then went to find number, somewhere in the corner I got the list and I got the number.

I came to officer, as soon as I came to window, the guy said ''2010 Shatabdi is scheduled at 2.35PM, you might not get seat today, you will be in waiting list''. Look the guy knew the number, still he told me to run and fill the number.

Class of Travelling

As I was travelling first time, I didnt know how many classes are there in the train. There can be 1st AC, 2nd AC, 1st Non AC Chair, 2nd Non AC Chair, Sleeper etc. So I left that field blank and said ''I am ready to go by any class which is available. So tell me where I will get seat and I will write that class''. The officer said ''Its not my job, You write class first then only submit the form''. I wrote 2nd/1st .. Then he said ''Shatabdi doesnt have 2nd or 1st etc, it has only one class AC chair class, write that''. Now I had to take new form and write everything again. This was so frustrating and also time consuming.

Conclusion

I was travelling by this train first time and I had been to ahemdabad first time in my life, so how can I know about class and numbers of train. Shouldnt these guy be a bit polite and help new travellers?. Shouldnt there be a list of trains with classes and fairs written somewhere? Shouldnt there be an interactive computer where a new traveller can search and get it. Obviously there is an Enquiry Counter, but guess what, it is often empty, or it is overqueued..

=====================================================

2nd In Train, Shatabdi Exp, 5.20 PM Feb 13 2003 From Ahemdabad To Bombay

=====================================================

Old Cople 70+ Age came in the coach

I got into train and I was sitting on my seat. A very old couple of age (70+) came in the coach, they were hardly able to walk comfertably. People helped them to get into train and arranged their luggage and their seats. They sat down.

Ticket Checkr Asking Proof of Age

Ticket Checker came. He asked for tickets. The old guy (Mr Patel) took out his tickets, he was senior citizen so he got 30% concession. Now Ticket Checker asked proof of his age that proves him in category of senior citizen. As I saw by my eye, Mr Patel was hardly able to stand without his stick. The ticket checker was rude and said ''you need to carry the proof. Show me the proof, driviing license or passport''.

Mr Patel unable to find the proof

Mr Patel, started searching his luggage. This scene made other passengers angry, and ticket checker said that it is written on ticket that you need to carry the age proof. Mr Patel searched over 20-30 papers in his bag and still not getting any proof, he didnt carry any important documents since his pocket and money got stolen three times in last week (he was actually from USA). I agree that he was also in fault not to carry the documents, but at his age, when he cant even stand without its stick, you must grant him some mutual concession. The ticket checker asked to pay the fine of 400 Rs. Mr Patel said ''what kind of rules are these? The proof is needed only to check whether someone is cheating or not. Look at my age, can I cheat?''.

Arguement continued for half an hour

The arguement continued for long time, even other passengers got angry. But Ticket checker said you dont interfere. After some time Mr Patel found his medical certificate. (By this time, he opened all his suitcases and everything was shuffled). We helped him to pack everything. Ticket Checker saw the proof and went. Mr Patel said ''I will definately write this as my worst experience in indian railway in news papers''. However I wish this review helps Mr Patel and other poor fellows who become victom of such ticket checkers and they have to pay in case if they dont find any proof.

Conclusion

1 Rules are made for consistancy of system.

2 Rules like carrying proof are made to check against cheating.

3 Mr Patel's arguement was 100% valid. He was looking 70+ by his moves in the coach. Ticket checker must take such things into consideration.

And obviously at end stage of life, when people are hardly able to walk and travel, they should not be forced to carry the proof, such people cant even remember things very well."

This is the official web site of the Indian Railways and provides a vast storehouse of Information at a click.

Train Fare :

This is a great facility to budget your travel expenses before hand. Provides easy computation of fare between two cities including Superfast charges and reservation charges along with distance in kilometers.

Train Schedule :

A great feature that provides complete details on the variety of trains that ply between two destinations and on which days of the week along with the departure and arrival timing. Gives you a choice.

Also features information on special trains.

An Updated Time table.

And a general layout of seats and berths in the coach.

Accommodation availability :

This is a very useful feature that solves our greatest headache of finding out whether our waitlisted tickets have confirmed or have reached the RAC status. Eliminates the need of the innumerable calls that we make to reservation enquiry number with no definite response other than 'Please wait-You are in Queue'

Tele Booking :

This is a great new feature wherein one can make reservations and book tickets on the phone. Presently available only in Delhi soon to be launched in many more metro cities. Requires a Rail Credit Card from the Standard Chartered Bank. Very soon to accept all major credit cards after the tie-up.

RULES :

Another very helpful section that details rules and regulations and educates us on the dos and don'ts while travelling. Like baggage allowance, Refund rules, deduction of cancellation charges, Senior citizen concessions, circular journey and break-journey and a lot more.

Special Trains :

Provides information on trains like the Rajdhani, Shatabdi, the Hill trains,holiday specials and the Tatkal Trains.

I also found a beautiful map depicting the railway lines connecting every remote corner of the country on this site under 'Railway Network Map'

A very useful link is the Internet Reservation Link which takes you to http://www.irctc.co.in and is a wonderful feature wherein you can book your tickets online in the comfort of your home and office and have it courierred to you. Rs.30/- per ticket besides the service charges of the credit card issuing Bank.

I have booked tickets online both to and fro (return journey) and I was pleasantly surprised at their efficiency. I was promised home delivery of tickets and lo behold ! The tickets arrived from Delhi by courier to my residence within 24 hours !(They had promised 36 hours) Considering Indian standards this is exemplary and deserves the highest compliments.

These 'E-Tickets' can be cancelled at normal booking counters anywhere but the refund proceeds are credited to your credit card a/c only and no cash refunds are available. Tickets cannot be cancelled on the net(not at present at least)

Check the areas of delivery before booking. The site is slow but I guess this is but expected. One can directly visit this site and one must register oneself before making any online bookings. It also provides most of the basic information that you would require for planning your itinerary.

It took me some time to get used to these sites due to the sheer size and scale of information provided. But I must complement the creators that its a job well done and a lot of pain and effort has been taken to address most queries that any traveller may have.

I think its a tremendous achievement and will go a long way towards making reservations more easier and convenient besides saving me a trip to the Railway Station to book a ticket. It also eliminates the touts and booking agents who usually mislead the gullible public.

5,"I got a bit Adventurous and decided to get my railway reservations on the web using the Indian railways website http://www.indianrail.gov.in . this required me to register on their website, one page form, very simple to fill up, I must admit that the validations on the form were very good. Though they have to add some more cities to the list.

I also took the courage to give them my credit card details, knowing that they are a PSU fills ur mind with fear of misuse.

I had to book a bombay delhi ticket. After the registration I went thru the process of finding the train and the type of seats that I wanted, and then proceeded to book it.

they sent me a email confirming the reservation. I could also see the reservation on the web. so far so good, my credit card was charged but I was still skeptical on the delivery.

but bingo, in 36 hours I recd the ticket. amazing is'nt it !! AFL delivered it at my door step.

u may also like to read the latest PC Quest, it carries a write up on the technology that the indian rail uses for e-tickets.

5 stars to this PSU.

one catch, u cannot cancel and geta refund, u can cancel and use the amt for another ticket. but its fair enough. I think they will be able to achieve this once they can do a reversal on the credit card. they also charge u 1.8% as a processing fee but its worth the convenience ."
2,"Hello friends!!!

My personal experience with Indian Railways has mixed feelings. Personally I feel that Indian Railways has a long way to go to find itself as the leading transportation in India. Agreed it is a cheapest form the travel and a vehicle for common man. But the Railways earn such a lot of income through tourism,etc. then why can't they maintain the trains properly.

Having recently travelled Northern Railways, I felt as if I am travelling back to when trains were first introduced in India. No proper system is maintained. Having travelled in a reserved compartment, the no. of people that started getting inside at every station was just getting on our nerves, causing lots of inconvenience to those who had secured a reservation. To add to it our Ticket checkers never bothered with such influx. Getting down to our destinations was horrible. We had to cross over people to get near the entrance.

I think the problem is the same everywhere, Or is it worse with NR Railways?? Why are trains schedule to leave for the destinations reach / arrive late?? Is there any hope???"
3,"I think that the railways.whic is the largest employer inthe world is crumbling under th epressure of the number of people travelling by it....theres a limit to everything.and the recent accident is only an indication that the authorities can not handle all things at one time.

A minister resigning wont help. Mamte banerjee should have made efforts to find the cause and correct the roots of the cause , rather than exiting the scene all together. It is more negligence on her part to haev resigned at such a crucial time. The railway is not to be blamed for lack of resource and absence of good technology and maintainence for such accidents. just imagine what would happen if only for one day, the trains of the country were to stop?"
4,"Indian railways is the life line of India. It is the largest organisation (in terms of employment generation) in India and it is also the biggest operator of railways in asia and second largest in world. It is the safest (surprised??) compared to any railway operator in terms of casualities in an accident and volume of people carried.

True some services or facilities are not upto the mark or may be below standard but railways is improving. With a restriction on ticket prices (no... I am not joking.) the pressure on railways is too much.

What with 1 lakh kilometers of multi gauge tracks and arround 17 lakh workforce you can expect some glitches or short comings.

What does 4.2 billion figure strike in your mind.

Rupees ....no you are wrong.

If I say People .....then you might say combined population of India, China, Russia, USA etc.

Well it is the number of people it carries per

year.

WOW ..... Now that is waht I call carrying people to their destionation.

Considering the above facts I will give them all the credit they need.

But the bottomline is ....

[Has to be at the bottom of this review ;) ]

THEY SHOULD TRY TO IMPROVE AND MUST IMPROVE.
"
2,"Indian Railways---hell.

My personal experience---once last year I got my tickets booked for my journey in Goa Express.My boarding was on 30/6/99 and return was for 14/7/99.The ticket maker gave me a ticket for 14/6/99.And the biggest thing was that the date of my return journey was corrected by him ,i wrote 14/6/99,then he told me to make the correction,i made it there and then .Even on my correction he did not correct it on the ticket.When I had to start for my return journey my brother asked me for my ticket as it was not confirmed,he told me that it was 1 mth. back ticxket .I was totally shocked as I was having my exqm after three days.But I was able to get a new confirmed ticket from there only.And then I had a sigh of relief.So be careful while booking your tickets.Igot my refund when I came back."
5,"How it would be true to say that the life of almost every man in India

is Railway as railway has become the part and parcel of their lives

This is the most convinient mode of trasportation in india. During the past experience

it has been observed that railway is not simply earning source business but a great

social service to the indian inhabitants. Their are many rail-lines which could have closed

down long back seeing the poor income but due to the political influnce it is impossible because

railway serves to the poorest of the poor and takes them safely at their home at jungles,big ranges

of mountain through the tunnels and over the bridges of rivers. In comparison to the other transportation

it the cheapest,safest an quickest having almost all the facilites which we see in our home.That's why I feel as we love

our home and having intimate relation in home like wise we have with railway and therefore my title

''THE LIFE OF INDIAN MAN IS RAILWAY'' justifies here so why dont invariably travel in railway.
"
5,"More Than 11 Million Passengers in a day More than 62,000 Route Kilometers( covering whole country) More than

1,07,000 track that is Indian Railway for you.

The first railway on Indian sub-continent ran over a stretch of 21 miles from Bombay to Thane in the year 1853,Since then it has come long way.

Though they are trying hard to move with times by trying to connect every possible place with rail network,there are still I think lots of improvement to be done in existing services, like to provide pantry car in train having its destination time of more then 15 hrs.

They should improve the tickets status atpresent its very hard to get tickets ffrom the booking counter, most of the times tickets are booked in advance by the brokers who then charge the passengers hefty amount on the tickets.

With all this diffculties

The INDIAN RAILWAY the largest rail network in world is still runnning and GOD only knows how it RUNS

2,This train is always late. when this train reach Ahmadabad it almost 1h 30min late from the ETD.So if you have any work after 2 hour I am sure you miss it. So I request to Indian Railways Kindly solve it.
2,"Nowadays Indian railway service in slow motion. Everyday sometimes run by 1 hour 2 hours late. But in other countries like Japan there is no late by trains. In Japan's trains are running with speed of 300 km per hour. But Indian trains have average speed of only 60 or 70 km per hour.indian trains looks like dust bins. The bathrooms in the trains are not good and they are looks like dust bins
